I had minimal vet experience before and through my degree, and COVID ruined my final year placements as a 2020 grad (they became online school instead). I came out as a veterinarian that had little knowledge and skill and as a result I suffered so much anxiety and imposter syndrome. It got to the point where I became scared of doing any consult where the patient was mildly sick and I almost left the industry.\\r\\rI'm now three years out and at a teaching hospital teaching final year students, and it's cool to see how far I've come. What helped me was a supportive environment while I found my confidence. Vomiting cases more complicated than a maropitant injection used to terrify me, especially if they came back the next day. Now I actively enjoy the puzzle of figuring out the next steps instead of reacting with fear. I have coworkers that love to contribute their thoughts and are there to support me when things still don't go right. Even if you make a mistake, then the least you can do is make it a learning experience for yourself so that the next patient you encounter will benefit from what you've learned. I still get anxious time to time, and I think my first year as a new grad was not great for my imposter syndrome but time and experience has helped me so much with my nerves. You should never too be hard on yourself as a new grad - I'm sure the past you in early DVM would be very proud of the things you've achieved as a veterinarian, and when you're a seasoned vet you'll also look back on how far you've come. All the best!|I'm an ER vet as well and I personally found this to be more useful over Thrall and radiology CE for my learning. Our clinic uses VetCT and when submitting radiographs you can ask specific questions you want answered. I usually have a go interpreting it myself and then you can get direct feedback from a radiologist. You have the option of discussing it further with them if required. I like it because they'll label where in the radiograph they see the pathology. I don't usually need them to come to a diagnosis but it's really helpful in situations like you described about wanting to know the subtle part of the radiographs, without needing to be awake in the day to speak to a radiologist.\",\n          \"Working for USDA-APHIS is always an option.

They told me it was just this clinic; if I went somewhere else, somewhere with more support, then I\\u2019d have an easier time with it and learn to live with it.\\u00a0\\n\\nLiterally the ONLY times in GP when I wasn\\u2019t crippled with self-doubt were when I was performing euthanasias and having end-of-life conversations. I felt confident, self-assured when I was approaching an end-of-life case\\u2014the way that my vet friends would talk about their GP jobs. And I realized two months into GP that end-of-life care was my calling.\\n\\nI stuck it out for the full year though\\u2014not because I wasn\\u2019t sure about making the switch, but because it took me ten more months to convince my partner, friends, and parents that I wasn\\u2019t insane for ditching GP to go into end-of-life care. They told me I was wasting my degree, that I\\u2019d lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.\\n\\nI took a month off between my GP job before I started with my in-home euthanasia job to reset my mental health.\\u00a0I\\u2019ve been in end-of-life care now for a year and a half, and I have never been more fulfilled or at peace with my decision. This is where I belong. And if I had listened to everyone else who had told me that I should stay in GP, I would be very, very miserable.\\u00a0\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not me saying GP is a bad fit for you. I just wanted to provide an alternate take to leaving veterinary medicine entirely.|I left small animal general practice after only a year, and even that one year was a struggle for me emotionally. I now work for an in-home euthanasia service, and I feel very fulfilled. It\\u2019s a much better fit.\",\n          \"A) all cat spays flank with modified millers. I have now opted to just remove ovaries instead of OVH as according to a few studies there is no difference and I find there is less tissue handling. Will do midline spays if pregnant or fancy cat where owner is scared coat will grow back differently. I use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, monofast/monocryl for muscle layers + SC and intradermals\\r\\rB) cat neuter, incision on each testicle and autoligation. No collar or sutures or glue needed. \\r\\rC)Dog spay, modified millers around ovaries as with cat spays but will go midline. Again opting for just ovaries nowadays. Hoping to learn lap spays in future. Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, PDS for muscle layer, monofast/monocryl for SC+intradermals\\r\\rD) dog neuters pre scrotal approach, closed castration ligating modified millers. Doesn't matter the size of the dog. If elderly dog will do scrotal ablation as well as tend to find these get very bruised and huge hematomas. Tend to use monofast/monocryl for ligatures + SC + intradermals but will use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures at times.\\r\\r\\rEdited with sutures\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Outdated and harmful practice|Like, the actual part that goes inside the body? Unless you're scrubbed down and wearing sterile gloves then that's definitely a break in asepsis.|https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/when-you-can-be-paid-less|What I've learned which hasn't been really taught to me earlier is that most mutable structures such as blood vessels, liver, the heart etc. need to be compared to immutable ones, primarily bones. You can have average measurements for a normal heart, left atrium etc. but with such wide variety between breeds and individuals, it makes more sense to compare pulmonary vessels to the width of the ribs, or heart size to the vertebrae. Obviously this isn't a one size fits all solution either, but it can definitely help with deciding whether something is normal or abnormal, and thus guide a diagnosis.|It looks like one of these: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumb_bob\n",

Outdated and harmful practice|It sounds like we are not being told the full story. If things really happened as you describe and the dog had a strong indication for surgery, then your medical director ought to be able see that from the notes and would tell the owners \"lol good luck suing\". But you say that they gave a full refund? Something doesn't add up.\n",
            "\n",
            "Either way, your MD should definitely have asked you about the case. It's always super important to get the vet's perspective in these kind of cases, so why did they not? Is there any bad blood between you? As I said, the information seems incomplete.|This is like the most common feeling in the world when you're just starting out. In fact you should feel that way. It helps keep you from making mistakes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The most important thing for a new grad is to have a solid support network where you work. Nurses who know their stuff are worth their weight in gold, and a mentor or senior vet is pretty much mandatory. Don't worry about asking questions - we've all been there. If I have a new grad working with me I'd rather they ask things all the time than make mistakes all the time.|Gradually transitioning before and after definitely helps. A reasonable clinic would give you at least a couple of days off prior in order to transition to staying up during the night. Coffee probably helps too but I don't drink that. I used to go 7+ nights in a row regularly, but thankfully my new hospital has a lot fewer nights on rotation.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is rough, bit there's also something unique and almost serene about nights too. Plus you get to meet the most interesting staff in the hospital and bond with them on a deep level, so it's not all bad :)|As a fellow left-handed person, doing surgery with right-handed instruments is annoying but definitely possible, and something I got used to pretty quickly. Back when I looked into it I couldn't find any specific left-handed instruments, but that was a few years back in the UK.|Coming from a different country, the claims that vets are underpaid is pretty silly from my perspective. I make the equivalent of $49k which is considered a fairly good salary for a non-specialised vet, so when I see vets making twice that just starting out (plus production however much that is) it does sound weird.\n",
            "\n",
            "But then I remember that the average student debt for vets in the US is almost triple mine and I don't need to pay for health insurance etc. So it probably evens out. However when I see people bringing in claims of 200-300k/year with some experience, the idea of being underpaid kinda falls flat regardless.|In your specific example, there is a big difference between overuse of metronidazole vs overuse of prazosin, with regard to the possibility of antibiotic resistance development.
