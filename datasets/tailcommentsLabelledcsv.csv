I would love to have a feature like that for our PIMS, but we use ClinicHQ. It's designed specifically for HQHVLCSN programs/clinics, so features like that aren't available :("
2777,canihavethewifi,2,"as other have said, it definitely depends on the clinic. at my hospital, CCRs/ CSRs dont ever do VA/VT stuff and vice versa. if reception land is very scarce due to a call out or whatever, the techs will try their best to answer the phone in treatment but that’s really it. i’m a CCR and im in school to be a vet tech so there’s been days where im in the back with the techs learning, but that’s bc im planing on being a tech there when i get my license."
2778,iartpussyfart,2,"There are european vet schools that teach in english and are considerably cheaper (we're talking total tuition well under 100k!). I know of a few canadians studying in Europe. Worth looking into!|I imagine it's free for citizens of the country but would cost for foreign students? That's how it works in other countries.. ie. at least I think Finland, Estonia etc.|In case this info is useful for you.

Here's a copy paste of part of a previous comment I made on someone else's vet school related post.

""European schools tend to have more affordable tuition rates but the vet med curriculum is 6 years in some countries (as opposed to 4 like in the US). But they also don't all even require undergraduate degrees nor previous experience to apply, though those things do increase chances of acceptance.  
European vet schools should be EAEVE (European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education) accredited but may not be AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) accredited. However, this doesn't mean that she couldn't practice as a vet in the US one day. She would just need to complete a certification program for foreign veterinary graduates and maybe sit the NAVLE (but I'm not familiar with all details). You can find out more at the AVMA's Educational Commission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates (ECFVG) webpage. [https://www.avma.org/education/ecfvg](https://www.avma.org/education/ecfvg)""

But I also learned there's another path to getting foreign graduate credentials recognized called the PAVE program (Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Education Equivalence).|Yeah, absolutely they'll cost something and take time. But if the other option is that a person can't afford to ever become a vet due to the crippling debt they'd incur, then maybe it's a still a trade-off someone is willing to do to achieve their goals.|I know at least 2 vets who's primary focus is surgery (one is soft tissue, the other ortho). However, they each tend to have maybe 1 day each week when they do appointments which are specifically for potential surgical candidates or follow-up appointments/post surgery rechecks for patients they have previously operated on. This is in Europe however, so it may differ from elsewhere.|That sounds really disheartening. I know folks who got in on their first try with no previous animal experience nor relevant previous degrees, but the difference here is country of application. Everyone I know went to mainland European countries.

Has she considered applying to English language vet med programs offered by European veterinary schools? 

Especially since you're based in the UK, it wouldn't be that big a leap to move to mainland Europe for the duration of school. I believe the following countries have vet med programs taught in english: Poland, Hungary, Germany, Estonia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Romania. Maybe some other countries too.

[Proposal 144, Vet Telehealth](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/veterinary-telehealth)

[Proposal 145, VPA](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/establish-qualifications-and-registration-veterinary-professional-associate)

> ""There are vet technicians that have mostly a two-year associate's degree, and then there are doctors of veterinary care that have 8-plus years of education. And nothing in between,"" Steele said. ""So we're trying to open it up so people can get more care.""

The VPA role (Veterinary Professional Associate) seem interesting, like a Nurse Practitioner for human medicine, I believe. This could provide a lot of staffing relief I bet, but I can imagine it could affect the demands for DVMs.|Not a vet, but rather a spouse of one. I returned to school myself for engineering at 30, after a decade of technician work. It was the best move I did for my career, especially as I was able to land a career job after an internship while being a student. Quite a few of my partner's vet school classmates are in their mid, late 30's when they began school so it's very much possible.

The biggest hurdle I'd assume, would be getting accepted into Veterinary school, but once you're in, it's doable! You'll need a strong and convincing application package, admissions is VERY competitive simply due to the limited number of Veterinary schools compared to other professions. Work experience can definitely contribute to the admission requirements.

If you haven't done undergrad yet, then yea, getting your bachelor's first will make a huge difference with vet school admission regardless.

I'd say in summary: you'll likely know your answer when you get accepted or rejected into the vet school(s) you apply to. Or start with a bachelor's degree in a preferred, related major first.|My partner has their NAVLE score out just now (~1:30pm Eastern Jan. 17th) from the CVMA NEB website (OVC/Guelph/Canada).

I have definitely been in your shoes and not passed it and felt like a complete downer. But this is the time when you pick yourself up and just go for it cause you definitely have it in you!! So as I said honestly my number one advice would be to reflect on the exam. See the report and see what areas did you lack in and even how did you feel during the exam (for example, what did you feel like you knew well or lacked on). Now I did vetprep 100% and still failed my first attempt, and when I reflect back I realised I was so focused on completing my percent, I didn’t actually retain the information.

2804,dinkiedinkie,1,"I can't offer much advice on how to get into vet school as it has already changed a bit since I graduated 6-7 yrs ago.  I will say from what I've gathered from the pre-vet and vet students I've mentored over the past few years, schools have gotten increasingly more strict about GPA cutoffs. When I was applying, Davis (my undergrad alma mater) was already implementing automatic cutoffs for students whose GPAs were less than 3.5.  It was the first school to reject me and it felt almost instantaneous :(

I got into Western (Pomona) on my first try at age 23 and at the time, they were fairly non-traditional and were very much more interested in admitting students with a variety of experiences. Age discrimination was definitely not a thing, my classmates' ages ranged from 21 to 48. I can safely say that my GPA was not the deciding factor for my admittance, they were way more interested in my research experience and I'm confident that was why they accepted me. My GPA when I applied was only 3.3.  This was in 2013 though and I know Western has only gotten more strict about their GPA reqs as well and prefer students with a minimum of 3.5 now."

How lucky was this small, broken baby to have been so loved. Even if you caused urethral trauma, it wasn't wrong to try and unblock a blocked kitten as that would have killed him outright. I had a string of 5 blocked cats not make it for various wild reasons (acute on chronic, also had a foreign body, were feral cats and too far gone, etc). How lucky for that kitten that he even got a chance at life.

Or you can tell the owner hey- this is out of the ordinary, let me go reference some resources. Or I do have other patients to see, I will continue to work with you on between getting these other pets out of here. People generally understand when they have a sick pet that you might not get a diagnosis upon exam only. You can also have pets drop off. You can also call the next day after discussion with your mentor, etc with a plan moving forward. You really think that the NAVLE is questions about calculating epinephrine and that’s what they can’t pass? Just make an emergency drug sheet and you’ll never have to calculate that on the spot ever again- and if you don’t, you should be using a drug manual to be sure your dose is correct. But when you see a chicken for the first time in 5 years with pox marks on its comb- you can go look that up. NAVLE is full of questions that not everyone will remain brushed up on- that makes it challenging. There’s so much info about stuff that feels very irrelevant to someone who is not going to practice medicine on reptiles, avian species, swine, ruminants, horses, and small animal AND practice public health. Need to look something up? You can do that. Need to call the reference lab and discuss the case with the internist? You can do that. Unless it emergency stabilization of a patient, there is time to make accommodations for themselves.

And if your mentor says things like this ^ OP? Run..

It's basically the same thing, removing an organ that the patient can live without.  Those procedures are usually either referred or watched closely and kept overnight.  Stop minimizing what you are doing.  It's anesthesia, it's surgery.  Things can go wrong, things WILL go wrong given enough time and chances.  An old Vet once told me to never say ""I would never do that"" or ""that will never happen to me"".  As long as you can go over the whole scenario and truly say you didn't purposely neglect something dangerous, you need to give yourself that grace.  Don't give up OP.

The employee would be chronically late and insult coworkers. I was very aware we had a toxic employee and literally did everything I could to remedy the situation by removing them from our workplace. Out of respect for the team, everything was kept behind closed doors. The only people who knew exactly what was going on were the employee, myself, and our regional manager (it was a corporate practice). 

Your managers may be doing all they can at this point. Depending on state and company policy it might not be easy to let this employee go. I had to give 3 written warnings, then give a paid day off, then accept a letter of explanation from the employee for their behavior for consideration before we could fire them.|Again, that probably varies. Toxic employees seem to know how to toe the line but not cross it. 

For example, the fact that this person routinely made coworkers cry was not anything I could write up. Clocking in late routinely was. After that warning, they started clocking in early (5-15min per shift).  Definitely a passive aggressive move.  Passive aggression I could not write up but the fact that it cost the company to pay for time/ overtime that hadn’t been scheduled was an offense that could be written up. 

No one wants to have a wrongful dismissal suit brought against them. Some also don’t have unemployment insurance and can’t afford to fire an employee so they are pressured to quit instead. Lots of factors apply.|One of the practices I worked for early on was a single vet who was terrible at business. He desperately wanted to fire an employee because he quite simply did not like her.

If you start your own practice, that becomes much more challenging.

If you think you'd benefit from a very involved mentor, be willing to settle for a little less compensation.|It happens to everyone. One thing I did early on was tie my knots too close to the clamp. Clamps can spread the pedicle quite wide, so if you tie too close to it the ligature might initially be tight but the pedicle shrinks once you remove the clamp and the ligature slips. Try shimmying the knot down a little bit or making sure you have a good crush to tie.

I am a double-ligater too, and I tend to do my first knot further down the pedicle (sometimes without clamping depending on fat) and tighten it down but don't crank it if I am worried about it tearing. Then when I do my second knot closer to the ovary, I really crank that one. That way if you tighten too hard on knot #2 and tear the pedicle you've got the first one as backup, and if it holds you know you've got good security.

Echoing suture size, and I do a strangle or Millers knot. There is a lot of confusion about Millers, Modified-Millers, so just double check which one you are using. A true Modified-Millers has poorer security.

Also worth noting is that usually in January both of those have a 'sale' so the amount of days you purchase for them extends until after the November/December window, if you're going to dish out the cash then it's better to do that. Zuku (and I think vet prep too) does question-of-the-day emails for free so you can sign up for those but you're only gonna get a hundred or so questions total by the April window. You can also poke around online, some schools have NAVLE-style questions on their websites. 

The biggest benefit of those sites is the ability to get questions with good feedback. So it really is worth buying one. You can gimmick the materials they provide but there's not much to replace the thousands of practice questions they have. 

Also, take ICVA practice tests to know where you stand. There are 3 of them, only one allows you to see which questions you got wrong, and the others just give a score.

A 'vet tech' is a veterinary technician, there are two common types, licensed and unlicensed. Licensed 'vet techs' have gone to a veterinary technician school, have taken an exam, and passed, they are equivalent to being a registered nurse in the vet world. Depending on the state and hospital, unlicensed 'techs' are trained on the job and may have little to no educational training at all, it's just a title to show seniority; some states or practices won't allow someone who has not been licensed to have the 'veterinary technician' title. Unlicensed vet techs are actually vet assistants but that title (in my and most people's opinion) feels too low for all they do; after all, they are not the type of assistant you see on TV who just gets coffee.

In the US, Veterinarians go to Vet school for 4 years only AFTER completing a bachelor's degree for 4 years; I know some countries have 6-year programs you can directly enter after high school (or equivalent). Depending on the country and the type of vet school you go to (6 year vs others) the AVMA may or may not allow you to sit for the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE). This is the big exam that allows you to practice in the US. I know some countries are can take another exam (the Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Equivalence PAVE), complete a clinical year in the US, and then take the NAVLE.

Go online to AVMA's website and I think you should find info relevant to your situation there, or be able to contact someone who knows more! I hope this helps!|Someone already said it, but you have to already have the Doctor degree or equivalent (or about to receive it in the final year as a student) before you can take the NAVLE. You can graduate and have the Doctor title but you can't practice medicine without taking the NAVLE. You could teach, work in research, or similar things without passing the NAVLE but you can't see patients or do medicine without the NAVLE.

The NAVLE is only for Doctors. Licensed Vet techs take a different exam called the VTNE.|Sorry this ended up being very lengthy!

1. while you are in high school do well enough to get accepted into a decent university and have an overall good GPA to help with this. A lot of universities offer different pre-veterinary degrees that you should go for. These (in theory) will make sure you get all of the required classes to apply to vet school. Make sure to take a ton of science classes and make sure to do really really well in them. Take as many credit hours (classes) as you are allowed. Vet schools want to see that you do really good in science, and that you can handle 6/7+ classes a semester, because that is what you will be doing if you get accepted. 
2. We are all burnt out and struggling mentally, but it is otherwise very rewarding. Take an interest in mental health and caring for your own mental well-being, you will have to do that a lot, especially in vet school. it is also worth noting that the vet world seems to be looking up. the older vets are all still depressed and struggling, but the new generation doesn't seem to be as bad (or maybe that is my experience)
3. to put some big scary numbers to it: the AVMA (American veterinary medical association) releases statistics yearly about the state of Vet Med. This year average student debt for vet school alone was $145,000. Starting Salaries were around 115,000/year for new grads. These are very subjective depending on where you go and other things, but these numbers are looking better than they did in the past. Also keep in mind that there is not a ton of upward movement to salaries over time, or there hasn't been in the past. Offset your tuition cost by going to an in-state school (the vet school in the state you live in, or a vet school that contracts with your state to provide in-state tuition to a certain number of students form your school), living modestly and not paying the highest rent around, scholarships, savings, dont take any grad plus loans, etc. 
4. some schools do track for large animal or small animal vets, but the NAVLE (licensing exam) is over everything and majority small animal, so most teach everything and you can go into one vs the other later. Also salaries for large animal vets are much lower than small animal vets."

Thankfully COVID stopped interest from compounding during my internships, but even now on my IBR plan, I’m not even touching the principal let alone the interest (7% interest on 340k is about 2000 / month) - so the interest keeps compounding onto the principle balance and that’s how you get fucked.

Hoping someone will take the case.|You're looking at the wrong position.. Look at support staffs wages. I graduated in 2021, and I only make 11.25. I made 14 dollars working at fucking Taco Bell. I literally MADE MORE making fucking burritos.|oh if I could just get a raise to that 14/hr, I'd be fine. If my fiancé didn't have his job, I'd be homeless or living with my parents. Im in Oklahoma, it's not even a high cost of living.....|I do too! Thank you for being so kind, it's nice to see when the internet can be so mean. I hope you have a good day."
2861,Dry-Cartographer7591,2,"A couple of guidelines I have been taught are: 

•Basically you want to show your interest by researching each school’s program, finding out what you can, and asking about what interests you, what concerns you might have, what might make that school a better opportunity or a better fit for you than another.
—I’ll give the caveat that with the way LSU SVM’s website was set up when I was preparing to interview, my digging was not very fruitful

•Keep in mind that the interview isn’t just for them to shore up their interest in you but also for you to shore up your interest in that program: Is this a place you want to spend 4 grueling years of your life? Are the clinicians there people you want to work with and learn from?

•In general—at least I’ve been told that—they generally have a pretty good idea of who they want to admit before the interviews; so as long as you don’t say anything too outlandish, it probably won’t hurt your odds of being admitted|I am an LSU grad (c/o 2021) and would be happy to answer specific questions you might have about LSU in particular|Any in western NC?"
2862,alemon9000,1,My first job made me feel like this. I was sure I didn’t want to be a vet. Then I worked relief for a while and now am at a clinic that I love. You definitely have options outside of a clinic but one place doesn’t represent all of them
2863,anonymous_capybara87,2,"I love ASICS! I wear them at the gym, labs, everyday life and it really helps my knee pain. But honestly everyone is different and I found it best to go to a shoe store with knowledgeable staff and trying on different ones to see which one I like best. The staff usually does a good job at knowing which brand and style work best for these type of jobs to help narrow down your search and help determine if it's a good fit for you."
2864,TriNel81,2,"My wife went through the EXACT same thing.  Get the fuck out of there as soon as you can.  The next clinic she found, she loved everything about it.  

Do multi day (2-3) working interviews.  After the first day or so, you’ll really see how the place runs and people won’t be able to hold back their drama.|Agreed!  OP, you have more power than you may realize.  The field/ industry is hurting for DVMs.  They should be competing for YOU."
2865,horsewoman1,1,"As someone who works inavet hospital...you are so kind. Putting an animal to sleep, especially a long time client, is so hard on the staff.
 
Chocolate always are appreciated, but a kind card is also good. 

Letting our animals go is the kindest thing we can do. It is never too early, it can be too late.

Bless you.|You got this. My hubby told me he was a terrible test taker. Grades weren't always the best. But clinical he killed it. Even got awards for it. As a Healthcare professional in school, I always wanted to have the best grades and did. But at no point was my grade point average a thing in practice."
2866,mimi279,0,"I do have a supervisor, but she only works in reception and i only see her once a week. I spend almost all of my time in surgeries on the weekend but on weekends it’s only the doctors, myself, and a receptionist- so i’m forced to ask them.

A specific doctor has told me he’ll be the one to show me everything- but he’s also the one that loves to berate me and gets pissed at everything i do (even if i point out a mistake that he made, that’s still something he’ll punish me for) so it is very difficult. I did speak to the head Doctor/owner about him and i’m going to change my shifts so i won’t be on with him once we get more staff (currently hiring)- just need advice until then."
2867,NootinWootin_,2,"To answer your question about the “send a message”- it’s okay to ask that way. I had to do that to ask about shadowing a vet and they got back to me pretty quick. If you want a faster answer though I would call or go in person.|Yes!! I agree! Volunteering is necessary when it comes to applying to some vet schools. Yea it sucks that it doesn’t pay the bills but it’s an easy way to get experience and form connections.|Even if it was a matter of confidence, that doesn’t mean that they have a right to yell or disrespect you. You have options. One is to speak up and tell them to stop insulting you and just help you by explaining what to do. Two is to leave that toxic work environment. No deserves to be treated less than just for simply not knowing what to do in a place you are new in."
2868,urmommyplace,2,Thank you so much!
2869,elarth,2,"No most people love my detailed notes because it makes it easier like a year later to know what actually happened. The ppl barely documenting things make it hard for ppl to figure out the situation well into the future.|No not unless a vet themselves but my experience is they usually title themselves clinic owner or medical director. Practice manager is not the go to title for vets running a clinic.|Not a vet but a tech. I kind of have aimlessly shifted between strictly preventative, GP, ER, and even shelter med. Lot of them toxic in different ways, some better then others. Was fed lies and even had moments of great apathy toward my patients from burn out which I hated myself for feeling. Felt like it was mostly picking the poison you wanted to swallow. Current company I work for is tolerable and my coworkers/boss nice. I’m hoping this company’s structure becomes more the baseline because its structure is to punt the less desirable personalities out of the field. They fire toxic behavioral problem ppl regardless how much money they pull in. But I’ve been scorned before by empty promises so I’m skeptical understandably. I know others are just saying switch clinics, but this industry has a lot of growing/changes to go through. I’m not going promise it gets better because I’ve had situations where even a minor change in management in a good clinic can easily turn into a roach nest of problems. You’ve unfortunately invested a lot of money into this career I assume and the good news is it’s heavily hiring atm. So I’d adopt an attitude you don’t have to put up with bullcrap. Employers acting shitty to me these days get laughed at and I’m gone. You do have a lot of power in the current job market. I’d use it to your advantage. Will limit the toxicity you have to interact with.|Depends. I saw more often doctors who wouldn’t do surgeries. Which a lot of strictly preventative care practices work out fine for. Saw plenty of vets do only surgery in shelter or lower cost spay/neuter clinics."
2870,thebenjaminburkett,0,"Not every clinic is like that.  Is the career shit? I mean, yeah. It's really gone downhill.  Basically everyone wants you to be James Herriot with regards to compassion, with Dr. House-level skills, Dr. Doolittle's ability to keep their unsocialized pet calm, with Am@zon.com convenience, and Wi$h.com pricing. I posted a poll a year or two ago asking   
 that if you could get 25% cheaper veterinary care, but your vet had to be homeless, would you do so? I think 15-20% said yes IIRC.    


However, you can find mentorship.  See if there's any way to get into ER medicine with a mentorship program.  I found that once I learned what critically ill patients need, and how badly most GPs do with it, I was able to do GP better because I learned what a GP really should be seeing and what messes you shouldn't be trying to handle."
2871,kittyschaffer,2,"Thank you so much for your answer. I didn’t know that that was the situation in Belgium. To be honest, a lot of the jobs I am interested in in Belgium are in the pharmaceutical/public policy sector, but that is good to know about the clinical sector as well. I really appreciate your insight!"
2872,johnolerudshelmet,1,"I'm going to repeat what most other posters have said, but from reading your post, it's the truth.  

This isn't a case of you not being cut out to be a vet. You have fallen into a very bad first job with a very bad first boss, which unfortunately happens a lot in vet med. I promise you, there are good owners and good clinics out there that you should definitely explore before giving up on general practice altogether.  

As far as this nasty boss being intent on burning you out during your 2 month notice, I would recommend 2 things. First, if you have an employment contract, re-read it very carefully. There is likely some language in there regarding a ""reasonable workload"" or something very similar. With all of the stress, anxiety and mental health problems you have accumulated since starting this position, I feel you would have a strong legal case to say your workload is unreasonable for someone of your experience level.  

Secondly, I would definitely chat with an employment lawyer. I noticed you're in Canada in another comment, I know the OVMA provides free initial legal consults, I'm sure other provinces associations have something similar, if not, pay a few hundred dollars to talk to an employment lawyer. This should give you a more finite idea of the actual repercussions of leaving before your notice period is up.  

I'm sorry this has happened to you, but just know this is not a reflection of you, but a reflection on a greedy unempathetic owner."
2873,selenakyle24,2,"Yes I have done it. I’ve switched out moved in to Tech( big goal is health or vet technology/ Tech). I absolutely hated my job and the clients. I just wanted some flexibility, freedom from guilt if I was sick or taken off, just wanted some normal clients and a normal schedule."
