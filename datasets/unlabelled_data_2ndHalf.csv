Seeing the sick or injured ones come in and being able to help them heal and go on to their forever homes is such a good feeling and it truly makes me love this field. I also love seeing neonate and very young puppies and kittens, holding and interacting with little tiny babies always makes my day better.|Funnily enough I started my veterinary medicine career the exact same way, I worked at PetSmart for many years and then switched to being a veterinary assistant at the Banfield inside the store. I eventually left for a different job, mostly due to corporate BS (feeling unappreciated by upper management, lots of focus on the numbers, etc) but I stayed for 3 years and I learned a lot in my time there and had some great coworkers. I was also able to become a technician because of their Penn Foster program. Banfield has a lot of cons, which people have told you already, but I don’t regret my time working there. Having a good team will make a big difference and each hospital is different, so I hope you will have a great experience if you get the job! Good luck!|I’m a tech in a shelter and I love being able to help patients that have nobody else.

1639,stupid_salad,0,"I'm a UMN c/o 2023 grad and the hospitals have the same problem. Teaching hospitals don't pay competitively so recruiting and keeping solid CVTs and VAs is challenging. Residents are obviously overworked and most have been shit on through 4th year, their internship, and now their residency and they're passing it down. We did report especially despicable residents and staff and their attitude would improve for just a couple of months.If it helps to know, I found being in practice, even as a little baby new grad, to be much easier and more fulfilling than vet school.|I say ""the most expensive treatment is the one that doesn't work,"" and in a more tactful way say they can waste their time and money trying ineffective home treatments, end up paying for another exam and more diagnostics when the problem is worse than it was when they showed up, and still end up on the expensive prescription.",,,,,

If anything it's more of an approval-seeking behaviour to try and do something really basic like give a vaccine yourself that you aren't technically supposed to do, she's trying to come up to your level rather than the opposite.Also, people will always value animals less on average than other people, so yes there will always be MDs who feel they understand animal medicine because they understand human medicine.|Cool and if that happened they would probably take their puppy to the vet ER, just like if their puppy were stung by a bee or suddenly developed angioedema.

Do they have the equipment handy in their living room? Probably not. You act like just because it's an animal that human medics would be essentially reading a foreign language trying to do anything with their pet. You only do us a disservice by trying to dig trenches between us and the rest of medicine.|Yeah so it's also animal abuse for farmers to vaccinate their herds/flocks as well. We should demand that all farm animals be vaccinated by veterinarians only, because clearly vets are the only people competent to do so.Also we should immediately stop all SQ fluids at home for renal cats, because owners can't possibly be trusted to administer SQ fluids by themselves.

Your job is distinct from your degree. You're referred to as doctor because you're licensed to practice vet medicine.|Do you really want to reinforce the Dr name as much as possible?|The general public will never understand most degree titles without substantial exposure to academia somehow. Many don't even really understand how MDs are different from PhDs. This is why I harp on about how title clarity is very important, more so in human medicine where many allied health fields have doctoral professional degrees these days (pharmD, DPT, DNP etc). |See I disagree. Your title comes from the job you are employed in and your medical license, and has nothing to do with your degree. It's a very america-centric thing to suggest that you are a doctor because of your DVM. What about MVBs, BVMSs, BVetMeds? Are they not doctors then? The DVM that never licenses or practices. They are a DVM but would you like your clients and nurses asking them for advice or diagnoses or orders in your clinic during a visit just because they have a DVM degree?|Your doctoral degree gives you access to the title in daily life but PhDs generally dont go around referring to themselves as Dr xyz in hospitals or clinics, except for the super self-important, because in that context doctor is assumed to refer to physician, MD or in our case veterinarian. Yes, when you get the degree you are a ""doctor"", but you're not able to take on the job of ""doctor"" in clinic until you hold a medical license. You can't give nurses med orders, you can't legally make diagnoses, you can't discuss prognosis or counsel owners, etc until you have the appropriate license to do so. Thus the title Dr. and the degree DVM mean slightly different things. There are DVMs who don't hold medical licenses that actually shouldn't be called doctor in clinic for example, as that is confusing to others, as much as y'all think it's devaluing to the degree.|But you have a license somewhere, which means something. If that non-practicing unlicensed DVM walked into your clinic, would you want your techs/nurses asking them for medical orders? To make diagnoses?Licenses are transferrable. Experience and practice with a medical license makes you a doctor. In a hospital, the job of doctor should be reserved for those who can guide owners/patients towards medical decisions. Job and title are not the same thing. Sure, PhDs call themselves doctor all they want in shops, pubs etc but not in hospitals and clinics.|MVB, BVMS and BVetMed are veterinary degrees from AVMA accredited UK vet colleges, none of them have doctor in the title and they are all specifically undergraduate or master's degrees. People will never ever understand academic degree titles and I don't think we should expect them to. Does it really matter whether or not they understand our specific training pathways as long as they understand the qualification? They also don't understand the difference between human nursing, medical, osteopathic medical, dental, optometric and podiatric degrees although all of those professions can diagnose, prescribe and/or perform surgery to some extent (nursing as nurse practitioners). It feels to me like the only reason to try to force people to understand the training pathway analogy is to soothe the ego. It doesn't take anything away from you or I as vets if Joe blow, owner of princess, thinks our degree was 2 years instead of 4. They can take the care or leave it until they educate themselves and figure out not to prejudge professionals.Also I should point out that although it has doctor in the title, DVMs are undergraduate medical degrees. They are just second-entry undergraduate programs.|I think you're drinking the Kool aid a little bit here. DVMs are undergraduate level medicine courses even in the US. It has nothing to do with whether you've completed ""doctorate level coursework"" or not. It's got to do with whether you've qualified for a medical license by completing an AVMA accredited course. DVM is just a fancy flourish of letters to increase Americans sense of self-importance. It's an accomplishment to get one obviously, but it doesn't qualify you to practice the job of being a doctor. It qualifies you to get a license which allows you to practice the job of doctor.Tbh my undergrad coursework was more rigorous and detailed than lots of my vet med course work.|this is an issue commonly discussed in human medicine but the principle applies here as well. do you think a nurse with a PhD in nursing should introduce themselves as Dr. xyz to patients? how about a pharmacist with a PharmD? DPT physiotherapist?what about MVBs, or BVetMeds? do they not get to call themselves doctor? there's no doctor in their veterinary degree title. RVTs who also have a research doctorate? do they get to introduce themselves as Dr. soandso to owners?your ability to fulfill a ROLE or JOB in a hospital is what makes you a doctor to the general public, not your degree title. youre conflating honorary titles of doctor in the social domain with the job of doctor in a hospital when they are separate things.yes obviously licensure in one state does not automatically hold bearing in any other state. once you have obtained the general substrates for a license (a veterinary degree, NAVLE completion in north america) you can complete locally specific substrates and apply for licenses with ease. in that sense, having a license in one place makes you roughly eligible to apply for licensure in another, especially when other boards request letters of good standing etc.|You're allowed to hate it. I couldn't possibly take myself so seriously. I suppose if you're working hard people will always recognize that before what's embroidered on your coat.|Correct, that's my entire point. A doctor can be a social title or it can be a job but for some people it's not both. For vets and MDs we are called doctor in the hospital because of our medical license rather than our doctoral degree.To be even more confusing, nurses can have research phds or DNPs which often qualify them as nurse practicioners.|Depends how hard you work in RVT school.

Yes if you know how to problem solve and find information you can get there despite a weak knowledge base but having the memorization component gets you through the problem solving faster. Navle success obviously isn't the sole predictor of success as a vet but knowing things helps immensely instead of having to look them up constantly.|How else do you address a fundamental knowledge licensing exam to an entire profession with so many diverse end points? How else do you justify allowing vets to literally switch focuses at the drop of a hat? No, not every vet is going to be omniscient, but do you instead want to change licensing to be segregated by species? How do you ensure that vets have adequate training and knowledge to work with the species they about to operate on or prescribe meds to? I guarantee schools can't prepare us adequately and I do agree fundamentally that board licensing exams can be problematic, but there are some really questionable vets out there with licenses. What do you do instead?|specialization already exists. examples include surgery, anaesthesia, medicine, large animal medicine, oncology, opthalmology, general practice. we don't expect all vets to do all of these things expertly. i dont think you need to be omniscient or expert in all of these fields to pass the navle. you do have to have an understanding of vet med and be ready to enter any of these fields though.|I hope you don't talk to everybody in your life with so much derision.

Those are easier feelings to understand and move past than just hate.|You think vet med is far less important than software engineering? The science that much of our world today is built on? One of the most rapidly developing industries worldwide? I think you're confused.|typo, i meant to say far more important. my comment still stands. i think you vastly overestimate the importance of vets to your average individual. animal health care has always and will always take a back seat to many other things. if you wanted a ""fair"" salary as a ""doctor"" you should've gone to med school. having a doctoral degree means virtually nothing. people don't pay you millions of dollars just because your degree has the word doctor in it.|LOL you're funny|Then you must already understand that academic doctors don't have the same earning potential as medical doctors and it's essentially because of variability in demand for their distinct skill sets as well as the mechanisms through which procedural physicians bill for their services. Human health care is an inevitable expense so MDs will always have protected incomes. It's easy then to understand why vets will never be paid the same as human doctors, and if we were people would frankly just avoid seeking care for their animals|If you went into vet med just so people would have to call you doctor you chose the wrong profession. Vet med is a first entry degree in several countries, completed in 5-6 years of undergraduate work. Let's be honest, most people's undergrad was a four year lesson in how to study and be professional. Most people don't carry content forward from their undergrad which helps them practice medicine.|Vet med is absolutely doable if you are willing to develop your own interpersonal skills and resilience. There is definitely tons of abuse in the profession but if you can make it through whatever is thrown at you in vet school you start to set your own rules when you graduate. Once you're licensed you are absolutely in control and the field doesn't have to be a hell hole. It just tends to chew up people who don't develop their constitution on the way.|No unfortunately ethical teaching is mostly wasted on vets.|Because nobody actually follows the teaching, utilizes ethical frameworks, makes consistently balanced decisions, or acts in an ethical way. Tons of my classmates behave unethically all the time and they have it freshest in their minds. People just come to their knee jerk conclusion and defend why they consider their decision to be ethical. The righteous mind by Jonathan haidt provides some very good insight into this phenomenon.|a very gentle but incorrect attempt to analyze my perception. no, these are genuinely unethical decisions, its not a difference of ethical values. im fine with people having different personal ethics to me as long as there is no direct or indirect harm to others. my initial post was obviously hyperbole. many vets do ethical things. my criticism is that they often do it intuitively rather than rationally, and vet students can learn ethical frameworks but act hypocritically in spite of this, or fail to apply them to their own actions.|God that's horrific advice. I agree on sticking it out but definitely don't handle rotations like that|I'm struggling to remember anatomy and parasites as well, and I've been at the top of my class for three years.

I don't know why people fixate so much on animal slaughter when most of it is aimed to be done humanely. It's the other harms associated with farming that I find more shocking, like lameness, mastitis, untreated infection and nutritional disease. If we're going to use animals for food the absolute least we can do is provide them with solid quality of life while we have them alive.|Organic food is a marketing scam to begin with and yeah I'll bet it has serious welfare implications. I've not spent time on an organic farm and I probably won't ever as I don't intend to practice on farm animals but it's not surprising at all.|Best to pick a school that is avma accredited and teaches in your first language.

I got rejected from OVC three cycles in a row, now I just don't feel motivated to return after having to go internationally for my education. Ontario would have to pay me the difference in my tuition for me to return home at this point.

Eaeve accreditation doesnt qualify you for a Canadian license as far as I know, without doing lots of additional, expensive licensing exams|OVC won't even interview students with less than a 90% average these days, despite their grade cutoff being 75%.

Students also seem to have a distinct advantage having gone to Guelph so in my experience if you went to any other university the odds were stacked against you.|Yep, I'm just saying the federal and provincial loans are not even close to enough to be able to pay tuition let alone afford the education. You essentially need to have wealthy parents to attend international vet school.|this is absolutely true, i know many of them from my vet program, but they are typically not canadians. the reality is that most canadian vet med applicants know of nothing outside of their provincial program. they all try really hard to get in and some don't even learn about international schools until their first or second rejection. the only students going to these international schools right away without a thought are the ones with independently wealthy parents with connections. most students who end up going internationally have tried in province several times already and are only going as a last resort.|OVC may not specifically select for guelph students but there is a guelph advantage in being in close proximity to the FVC, getting advice from vet student friends, having easy access to the limited feedback the school offers. i applied for years to OVC, got rejected with no explanation every year. strong candidate on paper, fantastic references from vets, human medical professionals, so much support from all of my colleagues, extracurriculars and strong work experiences. ill never know what they wanted me to say or not say, or what i got rejected for. all i know is i wasted three years of my life waiting for that school when i could be in internships right now. i am nothing special, and there are many extremely competent students in the exact same position that i was in, some of them are my classmates now.|No it won't as long as the school is AVMA accredited and you satisfy the other qualities and qualifications these programs are looking for.

Your main obstacle would just be getting a visa.  Where in the US are you wanting to go?|This is a good point.  I would consider euthanizing a cat with inappropriate litter box behaviors a justifiable behavioral euthanasia if the owners had made a good faith attempt to resolve the issue (c/d stress or calm, Feliway, etc).  My reasoning would be that the alternatives are to either live with piss and shit in the house or move the cat into a rescue setting (which will likely make the problem worse).  But I’ve heard of vets not agreeing.Edit: I’m kind of surprised by the downvotes, I didn’t think this opinion was that controversial.  Euthanasia is an option to alleviate suffering… if an animal is exhibiting behavioral pathologies related to stress or anxiety that havent responded to treatment I would think it would be fair to say that animal is suffering|I’m not a veterinarian.  I’m an animal welfare professional.  So what would you do with a cat that has behavioral pathologies likely related to stress or anxiety that isn’t responding to treatment?  Keep in mind, animal shelters already have to euthanize healthy cats with no behavioral pathologies every day.  Why should the cat that is suffering not be euthanized but the healthy adoptable ones should be?|I work in animal welfare and have this conversation a lot.  You say “we don’t have space you’ll have to take him to the city shelter,” and they say “I can’t take him there, they will kill him!”But the city shelter is going to do everything they can before they get to that point, and if they get to that point it’s in the animal’s best interest.  Euthanasia is an act of compassion, not an act of malice.  Animals get euthanized because the alternatives result in the animal suffering.|People (as in the pet owners) can make whatever decisions they want, but if an owner said they’re not willing to live with that are you saying they are bad people or are you saying they’re making a different judgment based on the facts available?Because an animal hospital that refuses to consider a euthanasia in that situation is simply offloading an (admittedly) unpleasant aspect of the job to animal control officers and shelter workers (who are actually the ones euthanizing in the animal welfare space, not veterinarians).  If the shelter has 10 condos and 11 cats, the cat that was surrendered for inappropriate eleimination is going to be the one euthanized.|Do you think veterinarians are the only people that have to euthanize animals?|And if the inappropriate elimination was obviously caused by stress or anxiety… let’s say it started when the owners had a baby.  The owners have tried nutraceuticals like Hill’s c/d stress and Royal Canin, have tried pheromones like Feliway, and have even tried psychotropics (let’s say they’ve even gone so far as getting it compounded in flavored chews).  So this family has really gone the extra mile.  What would you as a veterinarian say to these owners in a euth consult?|What state are you in?|So you’re going to rehome a cat that’s already stressed and anxious (enough that he’s displaying behavioral pathologies) and put him into an unfamiliar place?  And you think that’s going to solve the problem?  Spoiler alert: it probably won’t, so you’ll just have a new owner in the same situation as the old owner.|Would you charge them for the consult?I’d invite you to think about this from another perspective… an argument could be made that the cat is legitimately suffering: it is having behavioral symptoms of extreme stress/anxiety.  The owners have contacted shelters and have been told they will euthanize because they don’t consider this cat adoptable.  They are trying to do the right thing: they raised this cat, they want to be with it when it passes so that the last thing it knows in this world is a familiar face.  You can’t see that as an act of compassion, both to the cat and to the owners?A follow up question: by refusing, there’s a good chance they will not seek out another veterinary professional resulting in a worse outcome for the cat (getting turned out on the streets, getting surrendered to a shelter and euthanized by strangers, etc etc).  Does that change anything?Please don’t interpret any of this as negative judgment upon you, I’m just interested in your thought process.  This is like the trolley problem.|And who do you think is going to agree to adopt a cat that won’t use a litter box?  You’re being naive.|Not a recent anecdote, but my dad had a vet working for him in the 80’s and 90’s (small animal) that quit to go do a phd in laboratory medicine and it turned out really well for him|This is a subject I find really interesting.

But vet schools do seem to select for a certain type of student (probably because admissions are so competitive) that one of my former employees called “aliens in human suits,” and those types of students, whether they know it or not, have pretty remedial communications skills.

It’s 20-30% of the practice, but many of the vets that have come to work for us find the rescue work aggravating or a waste of time (which would be understandable if they were on production, I guess).I’ve contacted A&M to see if there was a shelter med student association I could talk to and they said there wasn’t :(|This is a different perspective (I’m not a DVM, I run a rescue and rehab center that is a partner org to an AAHA hospital owned by my father), but in this market you have all the leverage.  If I were a DVM, my contract priorities would be: 1) salary, not production… it’s a misalignment of practitioner and client incentives and you’re a doctor not a salesman; 2) staff ratios that align with my practice style; 3) defined (and followed) appointment scheduling rules; 4) standard of care established by DVM’s not practice admins or managers; and 5) a certain “budget” for pro bono or discounted work for “at risk” animals (basically, a commitment from the hospital to do at least a small amount of shelter / rescue work).It seems that a lot of the advice on here focuses on negotiating tips regarding compensation, but there’s only so much juice you can get out of that orange.  I know y’all all have a lot of debt and compensation is important, but I think it’s equally important that a hospital recognizes your needs, wants and interests as an individual.  Talk to your practice management about what you want and need if you want to stay there, be clear about it and that you intend to leave if those needs aren’t met.  If you want to explore other options, be very clear with other potential employers about what those needs are and that you want them to commit to meeting them.|There was a discussion about tattoos in my dad’s veterinary management group a few years back because someone had a tech with a tattoo of a naked woman and they came to the conclusion that anything more salacious than PG-13 needed to be covered.So, a group of 50+ year old practice owners don’t care about tattoos, and just would ask you to cover them if they’re dirty.

Not a vet, but have worked in both commercial and teaching farms for vet schools, small animal GP, and research models, which all required euthanasia in some capacity.As for facing it throughout your veterinary career: it depends what you want to go into. During vet school, you will do euthanasias, learn about them, etc. If you plan on going into small animal, sedation before pushing euthanasia solution is common for a “traditional death”. If you love food animal/population medicine, it is quite different from euthanasia in GP. Even on teaching farms we use euthanasia solution but I have never euthanized this way in a commercial unit.

I just find some of this so hard to believe. Being told you’re a waste of space? Perhaps you think people view you that way, but there’s no way someone actually said that to you. It sounds like maybe you didn’t choose the right vet school if there’s such a lack of curriculum in which you’re interested. When I was in school there were entire blocks and courses dedicated to production and farm medicine, exotics, chickens, and yes, amphibians/reptiles/fish. I will say that there wasn’t a whole lot re: aquaculture, but I think that’s because of how little need there is in that field. It makes sense to hire another small animal researcher: companion animals are where the majority of research is being done, and that is the sphere in which the majority of veterinarians work. If you want to go into a niche field, you need to understand that you will be responsible for seeking out niche experiences.|>it’s standard procedure to handle all paperwork and financial matters PRIOR to euthanasia. I’ve never had one single client raise an eyebrow about jt. Our CSRs always get that part out of the way first, so the owner can focus on their pet and not have to worry about anything else. No one wants to stop in the lobby to pay their bill after they’ve cried their eyes out and lost their pet. If you’re losing clients regarding this issue specifically, maybe it’s the approach that’s needs fine-tuning, not necessarily the protocol.Agreed. We’ve even designed our hospital so our euthanasia/comfort room has a separate exit so clients can go directly to the parking lot afterwards without having to go through the lobby.|Definitely not, but keep in mind that you are also the patient’s advocate and will sometimes notice things the vet didn’t, and it’s okay to speak up!

One speaker presented a host of studies that essentially said *nothing* you do improves the course of acute diarrhea (metro, probiotics, bland diet, etc). Another lecture recommended using metro when hematochezia is present due to its anti-inflammatory properties. I think there is still a lot of controversy, and I think the anti-inflammatory effects are honestly difficult to measure. Sure, the number of days to resolution might be the same, but is the patient more comfortable? Is the intestinal glycocalyx better preserved if there is less inflammation?  We don’t know those things. I use metro for appropriate infections, concern for intestinal bacterial translocation, and when there is hematochezia. Whether that’s right or not, I don’t know, but I don’t think anyone really does at this point. Prazosin, on the other hand, is something I don’t touch anymore.

You can also check out vets for different species, like horses, exotics, birds, companion, veearts etc. This exploration of the actual daily job beforehand is important. A lot of students quit, because it is way different than expected. It's not just cuddling puppies. It's a lot of working with humans too, and sad and frustrating moments. It's also amazing if you enjoy biology, medicine, learning how the body works etc. It's also very afwisselend, not a 9-5 sit on a desk chair kind of job. There are a lot of job options, so you could explore further what you like when studying. Many vets switch at least once between jobs like food industry, research or between different species.The job is rewarding but tough, the same goes for the studies. Go to the open days in Utrecht and Belgium. Remember getting in is hard as well, have a plan b. I think there is still an option to switch to the master veterinarian medicine if you finish the bachelor animal sciences in Wageningen and choose a specific course. You could go for Ghent or Antwerp too, but those courses are quite tough on Dutch students, because of the cultural differences and differences in school systems. If you're good at studying loads of info in ridiculous detail, Belgium could suit you though. Unfortunately, they have an entrance exam now, which is very hard to pass. So prepare to study hard for that test if you go that road.It's definitely not a requirement, but if you manage to find some side job related to animals or even at a veterinarian practice, you can get used to different animal species and also see what interests you.I hope I don't sound too negative.

They're giving you this feedback so you can apply it. Practice what you can with models at home, take any opportunity you can on the rotation to do the hands-on skill. Ask the techs for tips and to help you. This will demonstrate you taking the initiative, and you will be practicing, which should help both things they're critiquing you for. If you don't have a lot of experience, of course you're not going to be perfect--you just need to practice.Take a breath, stay calm, be patient while you're doing the skill. You got this.Being a vet is multifactorial--you've got the knowledge portion, surgery, technical skills, examination, people skills, etc. Just because you are lagging in one doesn't mean you can't be a great vet. And honestly, once you get out in practice, a lot of the technical skills get done by technicians... when I tape a catheter you can tell it was me because the techs' always look beautiful lol.",,,,,

Also, it’s something that no one wants to talk about in fear of being labeled a sexist is the fact that vet schools are now 80/20 (or more) female to male.

1760,FrostyMeowmeow,2,"I had a similar feeling when I first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after I graduated college, and it took a year of ""soul searching"" to figure out what I wanted to do with my career, as my degree was in general biology with a pre-med track. I decided medical school wasn't my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine, but also the concept of zoology.I shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics. I finally got a job, and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging. I vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week, ""What the hell did I get myself into?""The learning curve is STEEP, but you'll learn to celebrate small victories. It's okay to feel as if your client interactions don't go smoothly or if you could've done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure.My first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner. During my last year of clinics, I realized the world of medicine is MUCH MUCH MUCH more profound than it appears. I'm finishing my last year of specialty training (almost four years post-doc). The further you get along in your training, the more science you incorporate into clinical practice.I decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it's not GP. GP practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume, are expected to be jacks of all trades, and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors. I'm fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies. They do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist. Internal medicine is still very client-heavy interaction. However, remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front-facing interactions with the public; you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team, and depending on where you do your training -- students. Specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest, but also part of the pre-clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities. These aren't things to worry about just yet -- you'll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling.Take it one day at a time. It will be hard, but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face, knowing that you've made a difference in somebody and their best friends' lives.",,,,,

I’m sure there’s a happy medium between me neurotically double ligating and triple checking things before letting go of tissue versus rushing through and having ligature trouble. As a student, I’m not sure you’re even really allowed to be on your own?

This is probably location dependent much like corporate practices, and I've only worked at one university so take that with a grain of salt.From what I have seen my university cares little about past experience. We get a lot of fresh grads which may be in part due to a local veterinary technician school and the university itself offering a veterinary technologist program.

It's a lot easier at the university hospital for a few reasons, it's easy to reach out to colleagues, its a university so most doctors there love to teach, and generally management was more supportive if I wanted to do whatever procedure for my case log. Staff level depends on the department, a lot of the specialties rely on their students so may only have a few technicians, others have many technicians but they're relegated to grunt work and treatments.

My best option is the Caribbean (SNU/SMU) but that means paying out of pocket as they aren’t able to receive FAFSA.I can’t get private loans because these schools aren’t American. Personal loans are only 20k at a time and subjective to credit. Maybe credit cards? I’m justrying to figure this out. I can’t be the first one to have this problem. How did you guys do it? Please don’t advise me to give up. I have my in-laws for that. I have 50k equity in a house and 50k in savings.  How should I finance the 50-100k rest?

It’s unfortunate it’s become this way and honestly I wouldn’t even know where to start. It’s insane to me how people consider this school “reputable” in anyway. It sounds like you have PTSD; how the hell is someone going to pay thousands of dollars for abuse.|Can I ask what department you’re in? 🥹|But like how do you do that? It seems like the person you’d report to would likely just tell you to “suck it up” there’s a major issue here with the “bully’s” having too much power. I’m seriously asking tho|Thank you for sharing your story. I’m really sorry you had this experience. I’m really sad to learn this is considered the actual “norm”. It really impresses on me that we need to be the change. This HAS got to stop.|This especially sucks to hear because those vets all went through this; and you either end up bitter and calloused or in emotional turmoil and extend compassion as a result. Like honestly. You havnt “earned the right” to be an asshole. It speaks more about a person who has been dragged through absolute shit only to remain compassionate and caring of their fellow humans.|None of those schools will say anything about the culture and they generally have “deals” with the schools for being able to place students there, so even if they said they had insight; they don’t. I was told multiple times by a Ross professor before I started that they’ve “been to the school multiple times and they’re good friends with “so and so” and how wonderful things were. When I got here, during my orientation I was asked about Ross; I said “oh you’ll know this professor they come here a lot and is friends with___” I was told “that person was here twice for maybe two days. 🧐 like every step of this whole process is just lies. I don’t understand it. As a whole Purdue will stop at nothing to protect their reputation, not actually do something to benefit the people living in it. It’s hard as a student, everyone is afraid to say something to risk their degree or get some sort of backlash. So the people who CAN say something generally don’t. I will say the clinician that’s the higher up in the ICU/ECC department needs to go. 🖖 and the anesthesia department needs serious evaluation. I’m talking mostly about the techs.|Word around the campfire is they had to pull all the tech students from a certain rotation because they were getting treated so badly. Huge amount of people are quitting now and many departments are super short staffed, but they’re keeping the exact same case load|You would be correct|That’s amazing, it’s so frustrating that vetschool is highly variable as far as what the requirements are with the exact same end goal.|Yes, sorry!|I’m really sorry. There things I wish I would have known before coming here for sure. Ross tends not to be entirely transparent with its students regarding rotations. Welcome to the shit storm.|I’ve heard this a lot.|I get that, but I think that mentality is the problem (no offense here at all) I just think creating a situation where you tell yourself “it is what it is” and “this is normal” just perpetuates everyone’s bad behavior. It shouldn’t be this way, and because it was that way for someone before me, doesn’t mean it should be this way today. Vet med is hard, vets commit suicide. Like in high numbers. You’re career starts here; and this constant abuse even if it’s for a whole freaking year, takes a major toll on mental health. I don’t want to get a mediocre job after graduation thinking it’s amazing because no one is as bad as what I experienced at Purdue.|I never thought I’d say I miss ross, but I miss Ross. For reference.|I’m glad your experience was good overall; thanks for sharing your experience. I will never understand making students work 10+ hours while also having a lot of other extemporaneous objectives, papers, presentations, exams (other academic requirements that need a lot of time devoted outside of those hours) plus being on call and preparing daily for questions! it makes no sense. NO ONE learns well when stressed and exhausted, and certainly no one is capable of giving 100% being pushed to the limits. What’s even the point of that? I get choosing a job that might require those kinds of hours, but after a good education where youre able to rest, and retain things so you can be better prepared for long hours on the job. We need to be learning how to set healthy boundaries. Also, Ross students are forced to track mixed even if you want nothing to do with large animal.

I think my life circumstance has impacted me a great deal. The sacrifices and the hoops are so much greater. I’ve gone back and forth about what I’d do instead and honestly, that only adds to the anxiety of all of this. I’d first need to address the state of my mental health, which is certainly suffering. I don’t have the most helpful or kind husband and he’s the reason for a lot of the time I’ve taken off from school already. To be honest I’m so guilty at the thought of leaving our kids with him 24/7 as he has a short temper and yells at a 3 year old. I worry about their own mental and emotional well being constantly. Granted, finishing this I’d be able to be more independent faster, but the cost of that for nearly a year of them being exposed to that breaks me. It’s triggering as well as my parents were awful to me as a kid, my mom was never around and I’d be left home with the latest abusive dead beat step dad. It’s caused a lot of my issues I have as an adult. Including the anxiety I feel in finishing this at what I feelIs their expense.|Thank you I’ll look into that. I’mIn awe of how you were able to get through. I wish I was that strong. Thank you for the advice ❤️|If I reveal it, it might reveal me and I’m not ready for that yet… and it really doesn’t matter. I don’t hate it per se I just don’t think it’s a good fit.|I’ve already taken time off to try and figure things out, and it’s part of why I’m hesitant to keep going.

Lack of sleep makes remembering things crap anyway so it’s a viscous cycle|More like 9 months but I see what you’re saying. Thank you for your comment ♥️|Could be the same, some techs are super rude, but I’m sure that’s everywhere.|Damn I was going to ask for them to elaborate 😆 I’m seriously struggling to remember anatomy and parasites at this point, you don’t think that makes me a lost cause??",,,,,

We then offer a contact to work for us for 5-10 years (depends on your production once employed) in exchange for paying for the 3rd and/or 4th year of school, along with a 10-20k relocation bonus of which students normally put 10-5k towards their school debt. There is a huge need here, and practices are willing to help you if you perform well in school, interview well, and pass the NAVLE. Learning the ins and outs of production and evaluating what a potential practice offers in terms of support, education, and estimate padding without financially castrating your client base should be a high priority for all new veterinary students. Also, never accept an offer from a practice that has negative production accrual, or you will fall even deeper into debt and be chained to the practice forever. A standard production percentage for new grads is 21-22%, paid out either monthly or quarterly. Many new grads put this towards their debt their first few years practicing.

1860,Sad-Rhubarb1988,2,"I am sorry you’re going through this, it does sound like a very toxic workplace. I agree with what many above have said, but one question I had is are you constantly voicing these comparisons you’re making about yourself/your outcomes and the other vets in the workplace? This can contribute to why people are treating you rudely. No one likes it when their colleagues are being thrown under the bus. Hindsight is always 20/20, and something you may have now “caught” is not necessarily something your colleague has “missed.” If you are seeing these cases and sharing with everyone how you caught something they missed etc etc, that behavior can be off putting to them. If you’re constantly telling people you have no complications but so and so sutured omentum outside of the abdomen, then again this won’t be received well. Complications will happen to everyone, it doesn’t matter how perfectly you did everything. Something may be obvious to you at a second recheck but during the initial evaluation it was not as obvious to whoever saw it first. Please remember that, because it is never the intention of any of our colleagues to miss something, misdiagnose something, or contribute to surgical complications. You should bring up the rude comments your staff has made with whoever their supervisor is. If you have concerns about the other veterinarians in the practice, then it is something you can discuss with the medical director. I am not saying how they are treating you is ok (because it’s not). When a practice hires a new grad, there is an expectation of some sort of learning curve, need for mentorship, being slower than more proficient and experienced doctors, etc. All the staff should be used to this, and should be on board.",,,,,

That is my right and if it’s not honored, I’m gone.|Hey doc - fellow doc here - you need to go and talk to the office manager as a first step. Your entire environment there is toxic so it’s not just you. Unfortunately, very likely your office manager is a part of the toxicity so you may not get very far with that person and you may have to go higher up. I don’t know what your structure is but there will be someone higher up. remember this is work not a friendship, so don’t think you can bond with them and make friends with them, you don’t have to. But you can look them in the eye, and with a very pleasant smile on your face you can say hey I am a doctor, I do know what I’m doing, please put a cool pack on that incision as soon as the patient’s temperature is high enough and they’re able to thermal regulate. You also might check and see if the technicians have their own manager because I guarantee that toxicity between that entire team and all its members. Go and talk to the other doctors as well.Oh, by the way, you don’t suck. Being able to do a dog spay in 45 minutes is pretty damn good so be proud of yourself. No one expects you to be perfect overnight, don’t go for speed, speed will come with experience. Also, remember incisions heal from side to side, not and to end, so if you need to make space for yourself, do it. if something feels Hinky about a patient, don’t do the surgery. Be sure you are getting pre-anesthetic bloodwork that includes a CBC, tick panel, testing, and basic chemistry.If they are not able to get along with you, you need to talk to their bosses.

1878,PurpleOrchid2,2,"I’m not sure if you’re US based or not, but if you’re in the US you don’t need to be making the decision on vet school quite yet. You’ll still have 4 more years of a bachelor’s degree to expose yourself to more biology, animal science and chemistry courses to determine if vet school is possible. Being good at science is a strong requirement to be able to make it through vet school and it may not be worth pursuing if it truly is a weak subject for you. Also, going through a vet tech program is unnecessary (and maybe a waste of money and time) if you do ultimately want to become a vet. There’s also nothing wrong with going to tech school and becoming a CVT. It might be a route to a career working with animals without needing as high of grades in science as vet school would need. Just be aware that it’s a very different position and does still require science and math abilities. If you don’t have much experience working in a vet clinic, then just gaining experience shadowing or working as an assistant or kennel staff is the best place to start.|There are many decisions to make during pregnancy about risk that you can decide on based on your comfort level. I felt comfortable with just stepping out of the room when the patient was being extubated or if we noticed a leak/anyone started smelling iso. At the clinics I’ve worked at it was my techs doing most of the steps that involved more exposure (intubation, masking down if necessary, recovery). It has meant that I told my staff about my pregnancies very early on (sometimes before my close friends knew) just so I would be able to minimize exposure. If you feel more comfortable using a respirator, there’s nothing wrong with that either.|I think the short answer is any corporate will be location dependent. I worked for a Vetcor that was the complete opposite of your experience. A new chief of staff (started 3-4 months before I did) who replaced the former chief of staff that had just taken a role as a regional Vetcor medical director (or something similar?). The former chief of staff still worked a day a week at our location and was always meddling in EVERYTHING. She was also just a horrible person, so that didn’t help. But in my experience definitely not hands off from corporate. And we had absolutely no mentorship. Within 6 months of working there basically everyone with experience had left and we had two vets with 2-3 years experience and then hired 2 new grads that following spring. Hopefully most Vetcor clinics are better experiences|The starting salaries for new grads has increased significantly in just the past couple of years. Hopefully the pay increases continue, but there is the chance that if things cool off the high starting salaries may not last. I started as a small animal GP vet in a high cost of living area just 7 years ago and I was only making $73k my first year out. There also isn’t that much upward movement possible in vet med for either salary or title once you have a couple years of experience, so salaries may start out somewhat high but plateau really quickly. My husband in software engineering already makes significantly more than I ever could have as a vet and has steady raises + bonus increases every year even though he’s been in the field for a decade now.|I’m a bit further out (7 years out, 2016 grad) but I’m pretty sure I’m leaving the profession. I’m expecting my 3rd kid in a couple of months and have been working the occasional relief shift over the past year.

But I’d rather find a new career that I have a chance of loving (or at least not dreading) sooner than later. There’s a chance I may decide to do something that’s a pivot within vet med still, but nothing that I’ve brainstormed so far sounds appealing.|Thanks for the advice. I have come across that too. I’ve looked into the specifics for my state and there isn’t much extra needed especially if I decide to renew in the next 3 years (I just need to pay the dues then and have kept up with CE the whole time). Unfortunately since we’re down to 1 salary now, raising 3 kids and needing to pay out of pocket for licensing and CE, the $1k+ a year it would likely cost to maintain doesn’t seem worth it when I’m likely to not come back.|Please don’t go into vet med if what you’re looking for is a high paid job above everything else. And please don’t pick a speciality based on which is highest paid. Regardless of what you pick, it’s 4-8+ years of hard work (if you already have the prerequisites met and have finished undergrad) and going into significant debt ($200k+) to get there. There is much more money to be made in human medicine or many other unrelated fields.|I’ve seen maybe 2 or 3 non-boarded vets who only did surgeries. I think the ones I know tried to go through a surgery residency and didn’t pass the boards, so slightly different scenario than a standard GP vet straight out of school. They mostly stick to more complex surgeries (lateral tie, gastropexy, pyometras, complex mass removals, etc). They are also mostly an older generation, but I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it. I would guess that with today’s climate, there is probably a place for a GP vet who only wants to do spays, mass removals, dentistries since more and more GP vets aren’t interested in doing those.|I'm happy to share my experience although obviously everyone's circumstances and decisions are different, and my experience might not be that encouraging. I'm 33F, live in northeast US. I'm currently pregnant with my third kid and had my first at 28. I was working as a small animal GP up until recently (full time before kids and after my first, then dropped to part time after maternity leave for my second, and then left that job and have worked just occasional relief shifts during this pregnancy). I wasn't the type to always know I wanted kids, but since having them I have definitely chosen to lean into parenting as my main gig. I found that working full time with my first kid in daycare was fine when he was still very little. It was hard to not spend more time with him but I got some weekdays home with him and he didn't really know any differently at that point. Once I had my second and my oldest was about 2 yrs, it started feeling worse and worse to miss out on the time with them. I hoped that dropping to part time would give me sufficient time with my kids to balance a career and parenting, but it just never felt like I actually had time to enjoy spending with them. I do wonder how much was that the clinic was extremely busy with COVID era at that time so every day I was bringing home piles of records to write from home the next day. But overall, I felt very unsupported by my bosses through those first 2 pregnancies and maternity leaves (even though both were mothers to middle school + high school aged kids at the time). I didn't feel like I could take off any time before giving birth and only took 8 and 12 weeks respectively for maternity leave. They didn't bother to give me an adequate place for my pump breaks (or even block off enough time to feel like I could pump without also needing that to be my lunch or call back time). I'm at a point now where I finally feel like I can spend adequate time with my kids since I'm only working a couple shifts a month. I don't think I'm likely to come back to vet med after this baby is born although I don't know what I'll be doing next. I figure I'll take a few years to be a stay-at-home parent while my kids are preschool aged and then once they're in school maybe I'll know what my next career plans look like. I'm happy to answer any questions that may help you in your decision. Overall, becoming a parent is the most rewarding thing I've done in my life.|Thanks for your reply! I read both your reply to me and to OP. I can’t imagine how challenging 5 kids in 5.5 years must be! I will have had 3 in 5 years and it already feels like a lot, haha. Definitely a fair point that if I end up taking an extended time off the transition back would likely be challenging. At this point I’m so disenchanted with the veterinary field (how I’ve been treated during my 7 years as a vet, how corporate take overs will continue to occur, how little respect there is for vets both by clients and bosses, etc) that I don’t plan to come back to vet med unless things change dramatically for the better within the profession. I wouldn’t mind keeping up with a relief shift a month, but the out of pocket costs to keep up with licensing, CE expenses, liability insurance, etc doesn’t make sense for so few hours worked. I think I may have been leaving the field at this point even if it weren’t for my current pregnancy and maternity leave plans, but I do want to keep some space for the chance I could come back in the right scenario.|I don’t see it being a feasible career path if you don’t like medicine or biology and you don’t think you have good memorization skills.

My recommendations are: 1) Go to your in state school and work your hardest to take out the least amount of loans possible. Loans and loan interest add up quickly, and even having a great starting salary can make paying them off difficult. If you end up with loans well over 150,000, the monthly payment can be higher than a mortgage payment. It can be hard to fathom what that looks like until you have to pay them back. 2) Work at or extern at clinics you're interested in working in if able. There was a clinic I shadowed at once that offered me a job, so I spent 2 weeks as an extern my clincial year... discovered a toxic culture and what would have been a very unsupportive mentor. 3) Get varied experiences...shelter vs GP vs. ER, etc. Can help you appreciate the differences between each and identify what you might be interested in. 4) Work-life balance!

The unfortunate fact is that many students complain about any minor inconvenience and over exaggerate how much they actually work.  There are absolutely some blocks that are more time intensive than others. SA and LA med/surgery and ECC mainly. But even on those blocks we always got at least 1 full day off per week.  But these are balanced out by blocks with more leisurely schedules like Ancillary or Shelter Med. There are three big tips I have that can dictate how your 4th year will go:1.) Be as efficient and proactive as you can during the day. If you can do this you can usually still leave each day at a decent time even on harder blocks.2.) Be a helpful block mate and don’t dodge hard cases. Your classmates will notice this and will help you in return.3.) Approach every situation with a positive growth mindset. You have worked so hard to earn the privilege to work with real patients and you will truly be amazed by how much you will learn and grow in one short year. While no one loves being on the late shift in the ER, these are some of the absolute best times for learning. PS: even if a certain block isn’t your favorite remember that they are only 3 weeks and will fly by.",,,,,

Experienced techs are supposed to be there to help and support new doctors, not tear them down. Over the course of my career as a tech, I've found that bad doctors are bad doctors, regardless of how long they've been practicing. I've worked with a lot of new grads who were better doctors than the 10-yr experienced vet. Being careful, and thorough, is expected from new grads, and your techs are supposed to be there to help things run efficiently and be a sounding board if you need it. So this sounds like a clinic culture issue, and leaving is really the only way for you to have a good outcome. I would be very forthcoming about the reason why you're leaving, so the PM can hopefully get things fixed for the next new grad, but trying to get those changes in place while you're working there typically backfires, because the techs will blame you and things will just get worse (been there, lived that, and left the practice for a better one.)",,,,,

1917,Warrioryote,2,"First of all, congratulations in advance! It’s an exciting time getting to go out and take the first job! Don’t feel bad about being nervous or unprepared. It’s a lot to keep track of and it’s your first time doing it. Some practices may try to take advantage of that, but everyone has had their ‘first time’ doing this, and there are plenty of practices out there that will appreciate that and be supportive, even given the employee/employer dynamic. Many doctors and practices enjoy the opportunity to mentor and share the profession with new grads. I’ll try to limit my response to something additive to what’s already been posted, those are good replies with additional great advice. IMO first thing is to look at yourself as the asset you are. Practices don’t run without doctors and they’re hiring because they need you. You’re an essential piece of the business, even if you don’t feel like it yet. Even though you don’t have the most clinical experience out of everyone in the room, you -are- bringing with you the most up to date knowledge as a new grad, and experienced doctors know they can learn from you too, not just the other way around. It’s not something to flaunt, but being aware of that may help with confidence during the process. Veterinary medicine is a rewarding, but challenging and emotionally demanding work environment. Work culture is a -huge- part of everyone’s job satisfaction, so making sure you feel like it’s a team you want to work with before you bite is an essential part of the interview process. Little things like electronic vs written records, scheduling, whether or not you can request stocking meds you prefer to work with,  and big things like a commitment to mentorship and training can be everything for whether you love or hate the job. Think of the interview less as you being in the hot seat, and more as a way to get to know the hospital you’re looking at. You can say no too if you get bad vibes and feel like it’s not the right fit for you.I’d recommend writing out a list of things that are important to you in your job. Some things are obvious, like how many days a week are you going to be asked to work, or will you work weekends or on call. Some are less so, such as ‘do you have a quiet place to call clients’. They’re interviewing you, but you’re also interviewing them to see if it’s a right fit for you.  List questions and bring them with you to the interview. Everyone loses if you and your hospital don’t mesh so it’s in everyone’s best interest for you to try and find somewhere else if you don’t feel confident it’s where you want to be. Which brings me to this - ASK those questions about all of these things. Show interest in the staff and talk to them if it’s a working interview/if you’re touring the practice and there’s an opportunity. If you see things that interest you, ask about them. If you encounter something that seems like a deficit, eg: a practice that doesn’t have point of care ultrasound and that’s important to you, there’s an opportunity to say it’s something you’d like to do in practice and see if it’s an option to work towards that in the future. It’s important to think about salary and benefits and what’s important to you. Depending on the hospital you deal with, some might spring offers or questions about what you’re looking for during an initial interview. Most will not bring this up until they’ve discussed the interview and are presenting an offer after the fact though - ie: salary and benefit negotiation is something that usually happens after the interview and they’re wanting to move forward with a hire. If you do get that sprung on you when you’re not ready, don’t give specific numbers. You need time to review and consider things like final salary, ancillary benefits etc. and you can tell them to make you an offer - ultimately those details should be offered on paper, not by word of mouth. Do have an idea of the BALANCE of salary, benefits, PTO, weekends/on-call, signing bonus etc. that are important to you to engage on those questions if they happen, though. The AVMA has a new grad expected salary calculator by state and specialty on its website - it’s a guideline, not a given, and things like better hours or benefits may correlate with a salary that is lower than this guideline (and that may be worth it for a job you love to go to every day) - but this can at least give you a ballpark of what you can expect so you don’t accidentally undervalue yourself. If you have resources at your school for placement, reach out to them. Some schools will provide local business information where you are looking, some will even help arrange mock interviews to get the jitters out before you go to the real deal. These take extra time and effort to utilize, but they can make a huge difference in helping you land the perfect job. Lastly, when you do get that job offer - and you will, don’t decide immediately. Don’t waste a practice’s time, either. My school gave a guideline of a 72 hour yes or no window, but taking the time to have a contract reviewed, soul search your priorities, and negotiate changes is reasonable, and in many cases expected. If there’s something you don’t see on a contract that is important to you, and reasonable to request, make sure you ask for it. You may not get it, but if you don’t ask you definitely will not. Eg: if downtime or vacation is really important to you, and you think you’ve found the perfect job, but they’re only offering 2 weeks vacation.  Don’t ask for 5, you’re probably not getting it and it’ll sound wild. But saying ‘vacation time is important to my work life balance, is there room to increase that some?’ Is reasonable and may be something they’re willing to agree to in order to seal the deal. Keep in mind that this specific request (more PTO) can affect your ability to hit production if you’re on a pro-sal or similar pay system. Substitute your priorities for pto here as you will. Most of all, try to enjoy the process. You’re embarking on an awesome new chapter of your life and interviewing is an opportunity to explore what’s out there. Best of luck!",,,,,

Some vet clinics historically have toxic work culture. Is the turnover rate for support staff high? Are they always hiring? Those are red flags for me. Search up the companies you are being hired with on indeed or glass door to see if there have been good experiences for employees. If you have the option, ask to follow them around for the day. Listen to how the support staff talk when the vets aren’t around. Do you want a family close knit team or what have you. Work life balance important? Many new grads are focusing more on work life balance and a lot of companies are trying to get more vets by offering 4 day work weeks or 3 day work weeks. Do you hate surgery? Find a practice that allows you to never do surgery. My friend hates surgery and has found a GP that allows them to just see GP/urgents. Whatever region you’re working in, a quick google search can help find a rough “average” salary of a vet. Do some searches on Reddit to see if anyone posted about the salary they make. Big city? More than likely over 6 figure salary. Some rural area? Maybe mid to high 5 figure. (Assuming US) — also depends if you’re small animal only, mixed, or large.If you have to move, calculate what would be an adequate moving bonus (how much would it cost you to uproot your stuff and move) Signing bonuses for new grades range from 0-50k I’ve seen from my colleagues. Sit down and think what YOU want in a practice and what’s more important to you.

I am not sure I'd like to be dealing with exotics clients every day for the rest of my life. 😅|Thank you. I did apply for some dual programs but wasn't accepted. I paraphrased the criticism (but those exact words were used). But I think his biggest points were that I don't have an exact plan of where I see myself in 10 years, I'm not searching out enough opportunities (""why don't you have a fellowship with the CDC already?""), and that I will hate vet med because I don't want to be a SA clinician (that was my bad for mentioning I would consider doing SA GP/ER/relief work for a couple years to pay off my loans).|Thank you! Yes, his point was that I don't have any clear goals with a 10-year plan. I have been having a difficult time finding mentors because of my interests, though I think it's mostly bad luck. One of my favorite pathologists is out for health reasons, the only wildlife vet on campus is retiring, and a couple of the other pathologists I've spoken with are not very supportive. I'm not sure how else to find mentorship?",,,,,

Lots of people come into vet school wanting to be surgeons, and lots of people find that actually, cardiology, or shelter medicine, or dermatology really speaks to them and inspires a passion they had no idea existed! Or they realize that having to chose just one thing feels so limiting, and decide to go into GP to see a little bit of everything and simultaneously get to develop relationships with clients and patients that span the pet’s entire life. Or they realize clinical medicine and dealing with clients all day just really grates, and maybe being a pathologist or a radiologist is more their style. Vet school, and to a lesser extent internship is about trying different things and finding out what you really like, and I always encourage students to take advantage of those opportunities, because you just never know what will strike your fancy!That said, some people come in wanting to be surgeons and that passion carries them all the way through! It is a competitive specialty, so if you think you want to be a surgeon, it will work in your favor to start taking steps in that direction from early in your vet school career. Figure out a way to make contacts with the surgery service at your school- is there an on call student position? Does someone need help with a research project? Is there a surgery club you could seek a leadership position in to work with the faculty advisor and plan wetlabs? Make those connections early, and work to maintain them- having those people to ask for advice, to help get you strong letters for the internship and residency match, and potentially to get involved with research is one of the most important things you can do to achieve your goals. Along with networking, the other thing you want to do as a preclinical student is work hard in class to develop a strong knowledge base and achieve good grades. Grades are not the only thing people look at when choosing residency candidates, but they do speak to a person’s test taking skill and diligence in preparing for exams, and as a surgeon you will be expected to pass a multipart board exam. They can also help give you an edge over other similar candidates if your grades are particularly good. During your fourth year you will be on clinical rotations, so moving between different services in the hospital as well as externships. Here is where you will be pulling everything together, so again you will want to work hard and put a lot into prepping for your cases. Usually that’s easy for people to do on surgery when they want to be surgeons, but remember you will also have to do surgery on diabetics, and talk to clients about their pet’s cancer diagnosis, and many surgeons don’t have access to an anesthesiologist for all their cases and will be overseeing their technicians instead. So what I’m saying is every rotation matters! Hopefully, if you’ve been working hard in your preclinical classes and you continue doing well in clinics, it shouldn’t be too hard to find people to write letters of recommendation for you. Because the other thing that happens in fourth year is the internship match. If you go on the VIRMP website (www.VIRMP.org) you can see what applying for internship looks like. You send in your transcript, put together a personal statement and CV, and most importantly have 3-4 of your faculty write you strong letters supporting your application. This is where those connections you have made with surgery people and your rockstar performance on clinics start to pay off. Usually you want to get letters from at least a couple different specialists (not ONLY surgeons) because this first application is for a rotating internship position. As a rotating internship you will move between services (kind of like for clinical rotations) but generally you spend most of your time on surgery, medicine, and ER with variable amounts of elective time depending on your program. As an intern you are a doctor, but you will generally have some level of supervision and people you can ask questions, and depending on the program you may not always have primary case responsibility just yet. It’s kind of a weird, in between time, but once again it provides time for you to gain more experience and confidence with managing cases and talking to clients, as well as making connections. Once again, when you start your rotating, reach out to the surgery department. See if someone is willing to be your mentor, and possibly guide you into completing a short research project during your internship, maybe also presenting it at a national conference. Those sorts of things, as well as working hard again to make sure you get strong letters, will help your second VIRMP application be as strong as possible. When you go through Match the second time, that’s when you’ll apply for the specialty match. Most people apply for both surgical internships and surgical residencies, just because it is highly competitive, and even with the strong application you’ve ideally been building matching to residency straight out of rotating internship isn’t guaranteed. Most people do 1-2 surgical internships before matching for residency. If you do match for internship rather than residency, use the time to address any gaps in your application. Push to complete that research project and get it published. Keep making new connections in the surgery world and maintain old ones. Work to improve your technical skills and case management. Most residencies are three year programs (I think there are a couple four year programs out there as well, where one year is spent completing your research project). As a resident you will primarily be responsible for seeing and cutting cases. You will see both soft tissue and ortho cases, and will also be expected to have exposure to neurosurgical cases to some degree. You will keep a log of your cases, ensuring that you are seeing enough volume and variety of cases. You will also regularly meet for didactic training- journal club, case reviews things like that, and you will be expected to prepare several talks and present to your peers over the course of your residency (like for grand rounds). You are expected to complete a research project during residency (even if you already have a publication) and you will receive time off clinics for that and for the handful of out rotations that are required (anesthesia, IM/critical care, pathology, radiology). Your paper must be accepted no later than the August after you finish residency and must be in an approved journal. It cannot be a case report. Residents take Phase I boards as second years, and can repeat it again as third years if necessary. At the conclusion of your residency you submit your logs documenting that you have met all required case numbers/out rotations/presentations/etc, submit your accepted research paper, and obtain a final set of reference letters from your mentors. Assuming those items are in order and you have passed Phase I, you then take Phase II the Feb after your residency (most people graduate in July). Once you pass Phase II…. You are finally a boarded surgeon! Easy, right?|Spaghetti, I’ve worked with interns for 10 years now, after being one myself. Internship sucks. You go from being a student, where no one trusts you to do anything but the most basic of tasks, to all of a sudden being expected to be personally responsible for the well being of potentially very sick animals. Hopefully you have some degree of supervision/people you can ask, but it feels like everyone who’s supposed to be helping you is just annoyed with you. You’re constantly sleep deprived. You feel like you’re so busy running around and doing paperwork that you have no time to read up on things or review.Plus, internship further distills the Type A, driven, perfectionist types who go to vet school into the MOST Type A, driven, perfectionist types. People who judge their own performance harshly and have a hard time accepting any deviation from the way they think things should be. You make mistakes because you’re a novice, or you’re tired, or maybe it’s not even a mistake and just a difference in how institutions treat certain types of cases, and you use those incidents to punish yourself. Because surely, if you were a GOOD doctor, internship would be easy, right? It’s your mind playing tricks on you. If you haven’t been kicked out, if you haven’t been sat down by the administrators and had any very serious discussions, if you haven’t been instructed that your cases have to be supervised differently and more closely than your internmates, then you’re probably at least doing fine. Odds are that other people don’t perceive you in the same way you’re seeing yourself. You are judging yourself against perfection. Others are judging you against the standard they expect from an intern. ALL interns make mistakes. ALL interns have gaps in their knowledge. ALL interns have limited procedural competence. You are there to learn and gain experience and grow as a doctor, and anyone who makes you feel bad about not being perfect right out of vet school is projecting their own issues onto you. It’s ok to hate your internship. Maybe you’re dealing with a lot of toxic people, maybe you really have no support, maybe you’re being treated as cheap labor and a just meat shield in ER. It’s ok to quit your internship if it’s not providing the experience you feel will help you get to where you want to be. But before you do that, I would do a couple things. 1. Carve out some time to see a doctor. They will understand. They went through internship themselves, and if you look at any of the medical subs you’ll see that burn out and depression are just as common in human med. Ask about getting on medication to help interrupt some of the cycle of negative thoughts and emotions. 2. Talk to your mentors. Who is supervising you? Is there anyone you trust to discuss these feelings of inadequacy with, someone who can give you an outside perspective? Someone who, if there are any specific things you need to improve, can give you advice about the best way to build your skills in those areas? 3. Try to schedule time to see a therapist. Maybe look at virtual options to allow more flexibility. They can potentially help you identify patterns of thinking that are working against you and give you strategies to break these patterns. 4. It’s so hard as an intern, but try to carve out a little time for yourself to do some of the things you used to like to do. Most interns have so little free time that their main hobbies become “catch up on sleep” and “do laundry”. When was the last time you went on a hike? Or cooked a special meal, or did a little knitting, or sketched something? I think during training it is so easy to become dissociated from the person you are outside of work, but maintaining some connection with that person really helps. Try some of these things, if you feel you can. And if you still feel like leaving your internship, that’s ok. It’s ok to say “this isn’t for me”. But I hope it will be after you’ve taken a fresh look at the situation with a clear head, and you’ve realized your life plan is going to be different. Not because you’re holding yourself to an impossible standard, and now you’re crumbling, feeling like you can’t meet it. It’s ok not to be perfect, and it’s ok to forgive yourself for not being perfect, as long as you learn from your mistakes. You’re not alone.|You can also ligate the horns individually to prevent this.|Well, if you’ve been mostly on research rotations so far, it’s probably true that your technical skills are behind your classmates who have been more consistently in the clinic. That’s ok. You’ve got a whole career ahead of you to work on your technical skills. Everyone freaks out about being bad at things like blood draws- honestly, it won’t matter. You’ll catch up, and depending on the staffing of your clinic you may not even be doing it that often. I can’t remember the last time I drew blood; my technicians always pull blood/place IVCs/etc. Not saying your shouldn’t practice, but no one is going to ask you to demo your venipuncture skills in a job interview. Physical exam skills are where you should pay more attention. That will matter, and that is a skill to work on. Again, it will take time, but EVERY opportunity you have to put your hands on an animal, do it. Palpate bellies, listen to hearts, test reflexes, flex joints… work on building up an index of “normal” in your head so you can get better at picking up abnormal. Practice on your own pets. Get there early to examine all the inpatients/drop offs. Make notes and compare with the doctor on the case, then go back and look again if you missed anything. The part of your review you should take most to heart is the comment about needing more initiative. Your PE and assessment skills won’t get better passively- you need to push hard to develop them. But if you do that, you will gradually find yourself becoming more confident and competent.",,,,,

1967,inigomontoyajoke,2,"Went to Purdue. Some clinicians are good, some are nasty, and same for techs. I bet I know which clinician complained about posture! My first rotation they told me I talked too much and wasn’t serious about vet med (elective rotation). Second rotation they told me I talked too little and was too serious. But ultimately I did get a great education there. Edit: not to say that this is the only way to get a good vet education- it’s not. Also this does not excuse or negate the bad parts. Would have been a lot better if clinics didn’t make me nauseous some rotations I wish I could say it’s different in other vet schools but doesn’t seem to be the case. Have a friend who went to Colorado with similar stories :/|Honestly most of the senior clinicians were reasonable and helpful. Some of the residents were not great. It was well known that some people would fail a rotation because of a resident. Repeat the rotation, different resident, they would get As (the inconsistency and the judgement based on if someone liked you was frustrating). I had one block where the resident hated me, got a horrible mid block review, and by sheer luck ended up working with a different resident the rest of the block, and got told that I improved so much…By the same token, there were some nursing staff that were awful to people. There was a lot of favoritism there. Sometimes I probably benefitted from it. Overall I feel that most of the staff there was good, but there were a few that were truly unfair and seemed to have a lot of power in the reviews. I also received very few criticisms of my clinical skills or knowledge. Literally 95% of the negatives they had were about my personality. I think it’s because they felt they had to mention something (it wasn’t just me; a kid a few years ahead of me got told his smile was creepy and another girl was told she was too happy), but I came out of it thinking everyone hated my personality and dreading reviews.

My pets mean the world to me..and knowing my cats, they'd be terrible patients or just scared the whole time.

I would say for technician level, not really super important. It will come handy for a deeper understanding of disease processes and in pharmacology. Are you doing a bachelor's in Animal Science then doing tech school? Are you planning on pursuing vet school? Animal Science degree is different than tech school. Imo doing both is a waste of time, if you are planning on vet school..go the animal science  BS route and make sure you get good grades. The average GPA for most US vet schools is 3.6 and up. Hope this helps 😊|I see. Are you wanting to stay in the vet field in small animal? I'd advise you look at the content of both degrees. Animal science route will include a lot about large animal, animal management and care, and SOME medical stuff. Imo getting a bachelor's to move up to an assistant role is a waste of time and money. Doing a 9 month VA program would be beneficial for that purpose. If you are interested in management or government jobs, then do animal science. Also keep in mind that an assistant will not make much money regardless of the degrees. An LVT however will make more compared to a VA. Expand your horizon on your career goals and don't commit your time and money to something that seems like a good idea for 1 specific purpose. I don't wanna sound like I am shutting you down...it saddens me when I see a VA who wants to get more experience and move up and they have BS but make 12-15 an hour (depends on which state you are in). Versus an LVT who can make up to $50/hr (state dependant, specialty, experience). Versus an animal science BS holder- manager at a cattle facility that could be making up to 70k a year (state and experience dependant). Have you look at COL where you are at? Do you know VA vs. LVT/CVT duties in your state? Are you in a privately owned practice?

You are the first person to not assume I'm a new grad. (I am, though).  However, I'm also interested in practice ownership where I will bring on new grads and also will be receiving my first appraisal soon where I have exceeded my benchmarks.  I put a lot of work into doing well at this job and I know my employer is pleasantly surprised that they didn't take the financial hit that they expected to. I would like to know how much I've saved them by exceeding their expectations so that I can advocate for myself during my appraisal and not rely on my employer to tell me what they think.Some people may not be a fan of this, but this isn't my first career and I firmly believe that people need to go into appraisals with a firm understanding of the value they bring to their organizations. If my company negotiated a $100k salary expecting to lose $20k my first year and I exceeded $100k, then from my negotiating point, my original salary should have been $120k.  For the entire first year, I took a large hit whenever I took PTO as that is based on my salary and not production while they avoided losing the $20k they expected to on my salary.(BTW, this is not a critique of my employer as I understand that we both entered negotiations with an element of risk and I wouldn't begrudge them for using the data they have available which influenced their first and subsequent offers. I've also made up numbers for these examples. Ultimately, I was very happy with my negotiated salary, but if I exceeded the expectations, then I want to go into my appraisal knowing that and not rely on them telling me.)|It absolutely should be a concern. As a new grad, my employer negotiated a salary based on the assumption that I will not meet production goals my first year.  If I do make or exceed them (as I am now) then I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made come time to negotiate future salary.I also disagree with your opinion about pro-salary in your first job.  It may not be for everyone, but it has done well for me.|Full time, SA GP no ER/urgent care. I understand there are lots of variables at play, but employers definitely have an idea in mind when they negotiate salary for first year grads.  First year's are limited to the salary information they receive from recent grads and the school/AVMA reports... the employers, especially corporate companies have a lot more data to use when calculating a starting position for salary.  I just want to know what the employer expectation is.  I know they anticipate losing some money on a new grad w/ pro sal and chalk it up as an investment.  I want to know what investment employers are comfortable making.  Do they make a $100k offer expecting the new grad to only make $75-80k?|&#x200B;>new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.Exactly! So when I negotiated my salary, I negotiated in the dark with no idea about what my prospective production numbers would be.  However, I'm sure my employer had a pretty good idea about what they expected me to earn since they have access to lots of information about what first year grads make. And that's what I want to know. I'm happy with my salary.  However, as someone who exceeds my benchmarks, I want to know how much more I made the company than they truly expected me to make my first year.  That way, when I get appraised soon, I can advocate for myself.I'm sorry if you can't comprehend that a person can simultaneously focus on improving at their job while also calculating how much their effort is worth to their employer. I work for a company that makes money off the work my team and I put in.  We deserve to be compensated appropriately and if my salary was originally negotiated lower than what it should be, then I am within my right to fight for a fair salary.|Thank you for the answer, but I didn't ask how much I should be bringing in to meet my production benchmark, I'm trying to find out how much employers expect new grads to bring in.  I'm exceeding my benchmarks as is, therefore my employer is not taking the loss on me that they undoubtably expected to when they hired me.  I would like to estimate how much that is so that I can best advocate for myself during my appraisal. For example, say most new grads miss their production benchmark by 20%.  Then my company hired me at $100k expecting me to only earn $80k my first year.  The 20k difference would be the ""investment"" they expected to make in me. However, if I work hard enough during my first year to exceed my salary benchmark, then my employer didn't have to take that $20k hit for hiring me as a new grad. It means we negotiated a salary too low to begin with.  I would like to know that with quantifiable information as my hard work has made my company more money then they expected so that I can appropriately advocate for myself during my appraisal.|Thank you! I understand your point here, but what I'm looking to calculate from my question is a little different. It is well established that employers expect to take a loss on a new grad their first year as most don't meet the production break even point to pay for themselves in the first year.  Employers generally chalk this loss up to the investment cost of a new grads to make them efficient and competent enough to make or exceed the breakeven production goal.I'm in the position where I am already exceeding production goals, through my own investment in myself outside of work to learn, grow, and develop efficiencies. Therefore I would like to calculate how much I've saved my employer by them not having to take that ""new grad"" hit.  For example, if my salary is $100k + 20% pro sal, then my break even point is $500k.  If my employer only expected me to make 80% of that, then they really expected me to earn $80k of my salary ($400k production).  There would be a $20k hit to them that would be written off as training.  However, if I make or exceed my production, yes I do get my contractual payment, so I don't ""lose"" money, but I also have saved the company from taking that $20k hit they were expecting.  I would like to know what that amount truly is, hence wanting to know how much employers expect of new grads.As I prepare for an appraisal, it is important to know my worth in a way that allows me to best advocate for myself.  Having my production numbers is one way to do so, however knowing what I have really saved the company through my performance and additional work outside the office allows me to maximize my leverage.|I don't doubt your experience, but from everything I've been taught and experienced the last 6 years it seems things may be different now.  Every employer rep (private and corporate) who came to talk to us in school about negotiating salary stressed to us that they don't expect new grads to make production during their first year (which is why they recommended that we always ask for no negative accrual).  Even when I first started with my current employer, they highlighted several times that they didn't expect me to make or exceed my base and once I quickly started to they were genuinely surprised.|These are valid points and you are correct that I wouldn't rely on this information as the sole grounds for requesting a salary adjustment.  However, I would argue that there is value in knowing how you performed compared to how you were expected to perform in a quantitative manner.  I'm sure if I underperformed compared to how an employer expected me to perform, they wouldn't hesitate to bring it up to me.",,,,,

We had the same people come to us saying the same things about not making production your first year. I worked at a busy (not kinda busy, not very busy, just normal busy) 4 Doctor GP practice and worked about 40hr/wk. Decent split between wellness and sick visits, solid number of surgeries, etc. I didn’t make production my first month due to doing all sorts of admin stuff, occasional shadowing in the first two weeks, etc. I made production every other month from then onward. It truly will depend on where you end up working - if you’re in a MCOL city and above, you’ll absolutely make production. I have a few friends from school that did have some negative accrual, but they worked in more LCOL areas (think middle of the country). As much as money is important, I wouldn’t stress too much about the production aspect. Ask for 20% because it’s standard and be done with it. Negotiate for the highest salary you can and remember that you’re in charge - there’s a vet shortage that gives you *much* more negotiation power. Being a new grad lowers that obviously. However what you should push for in terms of salary varies widely on where you live.

The last surgery experience was a total nightmare that started with them not having the sedative to put her under on the date of surgery and ended with a tech bringing my 13 yo dog out while still POURING blood from the incision sites and sutures already coming untied. This required no less than 6 follow-ups for post-op care.  My wife was a vet tech for years and I am in biology research, so we kind of knew what red flags to look for. We notice a lot that were similar to what you are describing. That being said, I understand your position. I’m not sure how your field looks at previous practice reputation, but if that is a factor, then I wouldn’t want my name attached to that company. Sterility issues are a big deal and an indicator of attention to detail. Personally, I would hold out for VCA (have had some positive experiences with them) or look for alternatives. Maybe a smaller practice in your area. But I understand the need to acquire experience, so if you do go with Banfield I would keep expectations low and keep an eye out for better opportunities.

I received a very similar offer and the opportunity itself is fantastic, I just don't have enough experience in the negotiating and hiring process to know what is a good compromise and what to push back on.|It's sad, because I wanted to specialize (in equine internal medicine or advanced radiology) but after seeing what interns and residents go through in my vet school I decided it wasn't worth my sanity. I *love* advanced medicine, and learning, and teaching, and research, and I would have made a damn good resident and internist. But I want to see my fucking family, and ride my horse, and sleep more than 4 hours a night, and pay off my $300k student loans.And so I watch the increasingly desperate ads from vet schools for interns, residents, and clinicians and wonder what they'll do when there's no one left.|I was close friends with some residents and interns in my fourth year, and it physically pained me to see people call them bitchy and complain about them when I had watched those same residents and interns cry in front of me because they were so tired and overworked. Should they be lashing out? In theory, I'd love to say no. But it's pretty hard to be a sunny disposition and not get frustrated when you're running an entire hospital service with only students for help, your attending is MIA, and you haven't slept in 24 hours. The trickle down misery is so real|I don't have a lot of suggestions, but I just wanted to say that we as veterinarians really appreciate that someone who isn't involved AT ALL in vet med cares so much about this topic that they looked into it and are interested in helping. Perhaps reaching out to the AVMA (the national group that is in charge of oversight of the vet school programs and such) and expressing your concern as a pet owner that veterinarians are experiencing poor working conditions and you want to know what they're doing about it.One of the problems is that there seems to be no oversight: the AVMA likes to put out pretty words and ""suggestions"" like restrictions on student hours spent in clinics, but there are no consequences for programs that don't follow these restrictions. What this results in is that young vets are ""talking with their actions"" and not doing internships and residencies...which is going to (and has already) lead to shortages in specialties or select for people who don't care about fairness and just keep the same attitude, rather than anything changing. Maybe if the big organizations realized the general public is aware of their dirty laundry and concerned about their transparency and the blind eye they're turning, they would do a little more.|Lmao this reminds me of our communication training. We had ""scenarios"" with paid actors, whom we had to placate and cater to and never ever be honest with despite ridiculous scenarios- one of them was a man with a cat who ate a vegetarian diet because he was vegan and the scenario was that his cat had heart failure and he refused to give it meat/taurine. I also was once told that ""I didn't show enough empathy,"" to a client whose fake cat had kidney failure. The way I approached it was to explain what kidney failure was, gave them the options, and then waited for them to process it and remained a calm sounding board and answer their questions. Wtf did they want, for me to cry with the fake client over their fake cat? Not once has anything from that stupid class ever helped me, and I always thought the way they coached you to speak sounded extremely condescending, like you were talking to a child.Edit: FWIW, I have received rave reviews from my bosses about my communication with clients, even clients who have been prickly about seeing ""the new vet"" in the past. So whatever I'm doing is working|I can probably elaborate on what the previous poster is dancing around. What if your mentor isn't doing a good job, and you don't feel like you can go to them (or they're taking advantage of you- giving you cases that aren't good learning opportunities, being unavailable when you need help, etc.) but they're also your boss? How do you approach issues in your learning or place in a clinic when you are worried about your job security because the person you should be able to go to for advice is also the one screwing you over?|Where did you go?!? My experience was similar to OPs although we had more opportunities to get large animal and exotics experience because our clinical schedule was very customizable. But everything else held true. I regularly pulled 80-90 hour work weeks between treatments, on call, weekend treatments, and paperwork.|I didn't go to either, but I've heard good things about both. I've only known one person who went to Davis but she really liked it, I've known a few who either went to or worked with students from NC state and NC state sounds like maybe it coddles them a bit and makes it hard to get the experience needed to be a competent doctor fresh out of school (ie limited opportunities to do things like equine GP work because they don't have that as a rotation, less chances to put in catheters because techs do it most of the time unless you're really self-motivated and insist on doing it).Definitely don't just take my word for this as most of it is second hand, I went to neither. I think both are likely good schools|We autoligated almost all our cat spays (even pregnant...) when I was doing a shelter med rotation. It made me incredibly anxious at first and I did not enjoy it but I eventually warmed to it. I had several I insisted on throwing ligatures on because I felt the pedicle was fraying too much to be comfortable pulling it enough to autoligate. It is tricky to maneuver the mosquitoes to grab the pedicle in the right spot to ligate, but there were only one or two ovaries (out of like 7 cats) that I genuinely couldn't get it, and the more experienced surgeons did it just fine. I'm not positive but I think we autoligated male dogs as well?I LOVED autoligating male cats, very efficient, similar to a horse castration (my chosen field).I just hate surgeries in general and am very happy never spaying a cat or dog again!|The uterus we did with sutures, miller knots. But the ovary was autoligated similar to the testicle, clamping and twisting the pedicle around the mosquitos as close to the ovary as possible, then snipping off the horn/ovary, and doing the little autoligation push. I had a few where the pedicle sheared and tore while I was pushing the pedicle off the mosquitoes (I always noticed it before fully releasing, so no bleeding) and those ones I just kept my mosquitoes in place and slipped a millers knot down over my mosquitoes to tie deeper into the body cavity, and then ""finished"" the autoligation. It always felt more risky than the neuters, it didn't feel like a super secure grip on the pedicle to me. But it worked great in a shelter med setting with limited resources I guess 🤷‍♀️|Huh that's interesting. Yeah it's definitely a bit awkward. I think there's a youtube video about it from the united states humane society that goes over high quality/high volume spay n neuter, but it's been too long so I don't remember what it was called!",,,,,

2048,SprinkleOfWisdom,2,"Sure you can. I’ve worked with a small animal vet who then worked at the zoo a certain day of the week. So, you could work as an exotics vet and work with a certain zoo. Not all zoos can afford to have a full time vet. Also a lot of specialists might get called in to help at the zoo. Zoo vets are often huge generalists, so they often might phone in for advice from specialists - even human MD specialists. I saw that especially with primates. Possibilities are there, it just may limit some of your location options. The most important thing is to know there are options and focus on vet school, building good relationships, and trying different experiences in vet med. You may evolve your interests too which is great.|I'm a veterinarian in the US, so while I don't know the details of veterinary school systems internationally, I can say with confidence, that I would recommend shadowing several different types of veterinarians as well as the other roles inside of the veterinary practice including on the business side such as the practice manager. Observe what they do. Ask them what they like and dislike about their job. What would they like for their career path? Ask what they wish they knew or had done when they were your age. Never put all your opinions into one person. Take what they say and apply it to what you seem to enjoy and your values. Have fun and stay curious about possibilities. :)",,,,,

Most young vets have not been through a recession.

2054,Affectionate-Owl183,2,"I'm a tech at an emergency/specialty hospital...they aren't treating you right. Even if they were hesitant because you were a fairly new vet (which is somewhat understandable), there is no excuse for such harsh comments and judgement. I've been in my field for a long time, and unfortunately some techs can be petty. But the majority of the more experienced nurses I work with love being able to nurture fresh minds in the field. Maybe their feelings are more personality-based than medical based. Maybe the culture there is toxic. Maybe they ""don't have time"" for baby doctors and that other doc is the only exception. Anyway, I wouldn't let it destroy your confidence. You're fresh out, and you need a supportive environment that'll help you learn. And I'm sure there's a practice out there with nurses that would love to help you grow your skill set! When you meet them, don't discount their valuable experience (doctors aren't the only ones who can teach), and hopefully they'll treat you well and want to see you succeed. :) Don't let the bastards get you down!|Exotics Tech here!Most reputable zoos have their own vet staff. I work at a large veterinary practice, and when zoos/aquariums DO need our facility it's usually for things like our CT or MRI machine. Or our dental equipment. They tend to show up with their own staff as well. Our exotics department (currently five doctors) doesn't really ever deal with them. If you work in a state with lenient laws then you may end up treating some ""zoo"" animals being kept as pets (not really the best thing ethically, IMO). Generally speaking, zoo and wildlife jobs pay very poorly. The best way to do both would be to join a practice as an exotics vet and probably see if you can foster relationships with local zoos, aquariums, and/or wildlife rehabs. We DO occasionally see animals such as raptors (falconry birds), exhibit animals from pet stores (have dealt with a gila monster, dart frog, and a tree monitor), and we've had a few one-off weird things (one lady has a rescue and brought in a confiscated wallaby). But if you're looking to work with larger zoo species such as giraffes, big cats, etc...you will very likely not get that opportunity in clinical practice, and likely not without becoming zoo boarded or at least having a lot of specialty internships/a residency. I know several zoo vets, and have been in the exotics field/community for over a decade.|Most of the time you need to 1) be really well connected and know a lot of people already in the zoo community and 2) wait very very patiently for someone to die or retire so that a position opens up (seriously...I'm not kidding...)|Have you thought about a less traditional route?This is from AAHA's website:'of this writing, there are 15 states in the US—including Florida, Colorado, and California—where nonveterinarians are allowed to own veterinary practices.""I've known about this for a while because I read some articles about vet tech owned practices. Unfortunately my state doesn't allow techs to partner with vets in practice ownership, but food for thought. It would be a way for you to stay in the field, make a little more money (although low costs clinics obviously don't churn out a big profit), and not have the heavy debt associated with vet school. Food for thought!|Idk if you'd be up for it, but specialty hospitals are nearly always looking for per diems. You could stay on somewhere in a per diem capacity just to keep your skills sharp and your options open. An ER shift here and there definitely flexes your medical muscles. I know a few people who are semi-retired and still do this. I also know someone who does mobile ultrasound and does per diem work to stay on top of her skill set. And yet another who does two days per week at a slower-paced GP practice and a handful of ER shifts each month when she feels like it. Just an idea!|Not sure what types of species you'd like to study. I'd look up free vet tech CE. A lot of free CE online has anatomy-related topics. This website below focuses more on exotic animal anatomy, but as you can see they have a variety of free options.https://lafeber.com/vet/?s=AnatomyAdditionally, a veterinary anatomy atlas would probably be helpful as others have suggested (and you could refer back to it as much as needed). Even my undergrad ""Animal Anatomy and Physiology"" book has some very detailed pics of the musculoskeletal system in various species. Good Luck!|My time NOT spent in front of clients is my favorite part of work. I get to joke around with my coworkers (sometimes dark or inappropriate, but still funny). We sometimes talk about our personal lives (while doing x-rays, drawing blood, holding for ultrasound, etc.). We fall. We laugh. We get pissed on together. We jokingly punch each other. We can be blunt when we need to be. I just don't feel like any of those magical bonding moments would happen with clients always two feet away. The fact that I like and can mess with my coworkers makes the job so much more tolerable.|Lafebervet is wonderful for free CE regarding exotics (both at the tech and doctor level). Also don't be afraid to ask to shadow an exotics doc for a week or so. It may not seem like long, but it'll be very enlightening. Most GPs or ER doctors who approach them as if they're a cat or a dog do them a disservice. There are so many that visit us having come from doctors who never gave them solid husbandry advice, misdiagnosed them, missed something that the species is known for having (such as dental disease in rabbits) or just inappropriate meds/therapies altogether. I understand they're ""trying"" but honestly you really have to familiarize yourself with these species just as much as you would a cat or dog if you intend to see them. There's no way to just ""casually"" treat a few exotics a year without compromising the level of care.Examples:1) Spoke with a lady today. Her rabbit is MORBIDLY obese. Like I'd be concerned to put it under anesthesia. She saw her other vet for 7 years. They never mentioned this, and never asked what she fed or told her that she should not be free feeding pellets OR that she should have stopped having an alfalfa-based pellet at 6 months when he matured. Also didn't tell her to spay them (they have a notoriously high incidence of metastatic repro cancer after about 4 years of age).2) I saw a rabbit that had multiple holes in its face through our ER. Their vet was trying to ""drain"" the abscesses on its face (this is not appropriate in rabbits, their pus is solid). Did not attempt to address underlying dental issues that were causing the abscesses.3) 10yr old African grey that had wellness exams one and off over the years with their GP. The bird ""seized"" nearly every visit. They were told it was stress. Parrots are extremely known for atherosclerosis but this was never mentioned. By the time it had ""the big one"" (the stroke that finally brought it in through ER as opposed to the more minor ones it was having while hypertensive during handling events)...it's vasculature on radiographs looked AWFUL. It died in hospital. It's possible that sooner therapy and recognition would have helped.4) Every decrepit reptile that's ever been seen by someone who doesn't know reptiles well and arrives drier than a raisin in the Sahara because not one vet told them that reptiles take up most of their hydration through their vent and actually need to be physically soaked in water. Seriously the amount of things that come in for kidney failure because they've spent their whole life dry. So sad.5) 2 year old snake that had an under tank heater. Was seen elsewhere. Owners were told that the funny looking patch on its belly was just a ""rough shed"" by an RDVM. It came in approximately two days later for ""not eating"". This was because it wasn't a rough shed. It had third degree burns along the ventrum because O's hadn't placed the under tank heat far enough from the glass, and the snake was a burrowing species.I encourage you to try and help the exotics nuggets as much as possible, but learn from some solid people and really put in the time to do your CE so you can provide the best care possible!|Idk where you live but in the greater New York Metro area 100k (assuming you are a single person or want to live alone) won't actually get you that far. Especially when you factor in the massive crippling debt of payments most post-grads are stuck with. I only did undergrad and if I hadn't consolidated my payments I would've owed 800/month. Also rent near where I live is running like 2k even for the crap places right now. 100k truthfully isn't ""a lot of money"" anymore. I actually know several vets to have side jobs or work more than one clinic. Or pick up per diem shifts for extra pay. Welcome to inflation.|Honestly it depends on how important experiencing another culture is to you. You may not get the chance to live in another country again, and that can be a valuable experience. Personally for me living abroad isn't something I really prioritized. And as someone who racked up a LOT of debt for just my undergrad degree (and is going to be paying it off until I die)...I'd legit go with whatever school is cheaper. Debt really negatively impacts your life, especially your life as a young adult who's just graduated. Having heftier school loan payments may severely limit the types of jobs you're able to take (it did for me). I ended up having to turn down several dream jobs because they just didn't pay well enough for me to break even with my loans. I'm pretty happy now, but my debt level caused me to do a great deal of settling when it came to my career options. If you had any inkling to want to try general practice, shelter care, nonprofit work, zoo vet, wildlife center, etc... those don't necessarily make the big bucks. When I was young I went to the higher priced dream school, and really wish I hadn't. Of course, this is you we're talking about, not me. Just offering one perspective.|Don't stay there too long. You're still just out of school (2 years is NOT long). You need a place that'll challenge you to grow in your medical knowledge, and will allow you to find *your* way of practicing medicine that is up to your standards. Maybe consider taking a year or two to do ER in a specialty practice. That's the type of environment I work in as a Tech. It can be tough, but it makes for some REALLY clinically well-rounded doctors and nurses.I'd never go back to GP. And honestly I've seen a lot of cases that have been mismanaged (to the point of malpractice) by people working in clinics that practice what we call ""old medicine"". These types of places don't tend to be big on fully utilizing all of the diagnostics, don't have high standards of care for things like sedation/anesthesia (YES an OHE should be intubated, always), tend to have doctors that ONLY feel comfortable recommending drugs that have been used for decades, and often have lost their passion when it comes to themselves and their staff keeping up on current CE/innovations in the field. Sounds like you may be in one such place. I'm in an environment where most of the techs know how to interpret bloodwork, manage DKAs, do complex wound care, run a code, spot and identify arrhythmias, etc. Even for our exotics, we intubate almost everything and do preventive bloodwork. Imagine what you could learn, and what you could be allowed to do if you worked with a team that all strived for a higher standard of care. Best of luck!",,,,,

Once you get into school, it becomes completely up to you what you want to practice.

I hope the extra work on her will light a fire under someone's ass to make this a priority.  There is no way i can take my own history and TPR's without seeing a LOT less clients... but I guess that is an option... if I see less, the owner may make it more of a priority.|>Could you alter you schedule so that you have the last hour (never works!🤣), the first hour, or lunch, to catch up on paperwork?Thats next!  As I mentioned, I am sending a list of the notes that do not have histories done (from the previous day) every day to the OM for her to deal with.  If it doesn't get corrected (and, to be fair, I am not talking about the occasional missed history, I am talking about +50% in a day!), I will be blocking off the last 2 hours of the day for ""Tech Appointment Catchup"", and then just going home.While I am not going to quit over this, if the owner starts seeing blocked-off appointments at the end of the day, they may start taking a more active role in enforcing the rules.|>and you don't have the information you need to deal appropriately with the patient and client?To be clear, i am getting full/complete histories (everything I need to do my job), but they are not being put into the records.  By the time I get to it (writing my notes), I may not remember all the details - and I get stuck with incomplete notes/histories.  >You might be seeing more clients, but you're leaving that much more work unfinished. I don't think that's a wise trade off. I agree!  I just feel like I should be the bottleneck (in regards to how many patients I can treat in a day), not support staff.  Let me clarify, 'up to a point'.  I understand sometimes support staff gets overwhelmed, but we are talking about 12-15 wellness appointments a day here... not a busy ER.|>So the offer is basically 140k base plus 20% production on service, 15% on products and 5% on prescription.I do not understand this... are you saying they are offering you 140k base **PLUS** 20% on services?  I mean, if so, I would be all over that in a heart beat!Or is it a prosal model, where you are getting 20% production on services... with a 140k base (because that sucks!)|>No! It’s 140k guaranteed but I don’t know how much do I have to pull in before the production kick in. The 20% is only on top of what you makes more. Yeah, thats what I thought.  I think that sucks TBH.Basically, you have to produce 700K for the hospital (175K per quarter) in services before you see a production check.    >This is pretty standard pro Sal stuff.It is, but you said 140k **+** 20% (thats not standard prosal).  But I now understand what you mean.I think ""20% production on service, 15% on products and 5% on prescription"" Sucks!  I get 22% on EVERYTHING except 15% on food and flea/tick products.I mean, Cytopoint injections, Proheart injections, Apoquel, some Antibiotics, are a large % of your gross.  Unless you are doing a ton of surgeries, you are going to have a really hard time making production IMO.Also, do labs count as 'services'!?  I assume so, but don't be sure.I think 22% is probably the norm, the highest I ever got was 25%.Another big question (and it's HUGE), but do your PTO days get pro-rated with respect to your production?!  If not, its not PTO (and you are losing money when you take your time off)|When I first got out I would jump at the chance to come in and shadow with an experienced vet and do any procedure that I wasn't 100% comfortable with.  I learned 90% of all the surgeries I currently do in the first 2 years after I graduated!Now is your chance to grow as a new vet (it gets harder to learn (or want to learn) new things as time goes on).  Yeah, it's your day off, but it will pay dividends down the line.    Perhaps (if you are willing), explain that you want to come in on your days off, but those particular days just were not possible.  Give him a few other options over the next week or two (or month) where you can come in and shadow/learn more advanced procedures. You cannot rightfully expect him to use HIS time to help you when you are in trouble on YOUR time.  Sure, we all get in over our heads, and some help is always going to be needed (even for older vets), but you shouldn't expect someone to come running to help you when you (and you will) drop a pedicle if you are not willing to put in the extra time now.|>If the only surgical mentorship/training offered is unpaid extra days of work that is not appropriate. If I am teaching a new grad to do routine surgeries, then I am not working (basically the same as coming in on my day off).  It's one thing to jump into surgery to help with something, it's another to be training them.  It sounds like OP needs a bit more help than the occasional question.  NOTE: I am not suggesting that I wouldn't help a new grad do a complicated/non-routine surgery, but just as I am willing to take my time to help them, so should the new grad use their *personal* time to learn.|Not really.  Unless a level of mentoring and hand-holding was baked into the contract (or employment agreement), your boss would expect you to do all reasonable procedures from the day you were hired (and OHE's and IVC placement are certainly reasonable skills for a licensed veterinarian).  I personally wouldn't hire a vet that only had one spay under their belt (unless there was an agreement that the vet wouldn't be doing surgeries).|>he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks.I am not exactly sure what that means... graduate salary?

My 2 cents:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
\- Sometimes bloodwork is necessary, regardless of the surgery (sick patient,, history of organ dysfunction, etc.),,,,
,,,,,,,,
\- Sometimes it is good based on the breed (Dobermans can have a bleeding disorder, Yorkies and other small breeds are predisposed to liver shunts),,,,,,,

\- Sometimes it's necessary based on the surgery you are doing (liver biopsies, splenectomies,, ect),,,,,
,,,,,,,,
\- Sometimes age plays a role; older patients have an increased risk of a relevant problem,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
But... in young healthy dogs, for routine (and some non-routine) procedures,, I feel like its unnecessary.  Sure, its 'good' information to have before going in, but if you have suture up a laceration or remove a ruptured eye, are you going to not perform the surgery because an owner refuses bloodwork?  Some people will, but I feel you should just document the clients refusal and do the best you can.,

Also, are you placing the ligature in the crushed tissue from your hemostat?  I presume so.  I use a three-clamp technique (two proximal to the ovary,, one at the proper ligament), I also cut just distal to the second hemostat before placing my ligature.  That scares some newer vets, but I find once you get the ovary out of the way, it easier to make a secure knot.,,

Maybe things have changed, but when I worked for C Barn I saw his residents working 100 hour weeks regularly, sleeping at the barn when they could, skipping meals, and being reduced to tears on a regular basis. When I rotated through C Barn as a 4th year with him I was there 80-100h/week. He also mandated that vet students work outdoors without providing appropriate respiratory PPE during the California Camp fires when the air quality in Davis was the worst in the WORLD. Let’s just say I’m very much not a fan.|I think things have changed, going home at 6pm was absolutely unheard of when I was at Davis and especially on C barn. Per the 4th year below, it does seem things have improved.|I’m happy you had a different experience. Again, I graduated in 2019, so before you matriculated, and I know that some things have changed since then. I’ve been told 4th year students are no longer required to provide 6am/6pm treatments? So that does help to shorten a day significantly. I never heard of a 6pm cutoff time, especially since that’s when evening treatments were due.I was also livestock track and worked in C barn for 2.5 years as a Barn Nurse. I spent 5 weeks in C barn (as one of my rotations fell during a holiday) and can only speak to my experiences seeing how students and residents were treated during my time, so I did so. I do feel that Dr. Chigerwe is a fantastic clinician and lecturer, and I felt that in lecture, he was very sensitive and responsive to student questions and mental health issues. This was not the case in clinic. I’m sorry to say it seemed like a trend - I saw more than one incidence where an exhausted student or resident was openly sobbing and he reacted in an absolutely frigid way. On one day while on rotation with Chigerwe, I was told to show back up at 6am after working a 14h day and then being called in overnight, so had at best an hour of sleep. I’m sorry to speak negatively of a colleague but my experiences with him left such an impression as to make me overprotective of my own veterinary student externs (I now work in high volume spay/neuter because I enjoyed the extensive surgery experience we had on livestock track). I agree that the major issue is systemic, but when individuals feed into the system it helps to perpetuate it. I think that calling colleagues out on behavior that goes against the tenants set out by the AVMA is not only acceptable, but necessary to protect ourselves. If you saw a veterinary colleague abusing animals, would you not fail to act or say something? It’s time we did the same for each other. It is the faculty’s job to advocate for those who are trying to learn from them and I’m happy that he is now appearing to do so.|It honestly doesn’t sound then like things have changed enough, even as you defend him.Even if you slept every single one of those 6h instead of taking care of whatever other human needs you’ve been neglecting, we know anything less than 7h has an impact on your mental and physical health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/ . We are doctors who should be basing decisions from peer-reviewed research, so I’m curious how Dr. Chigerwe arrived at the idea that 6h off is acceptable. Perhaps the mental toll of chronic sleep deprivation is why I’m aware of several egregious medical and surgical errors on the part of the residents in C Barn. And I can’t hardly fault them because with that degree of chronic sleep deprivation, they were essentially trying to be doctors under the same effects as heavy intoxication. And why hasn’t the livestock service hired more student workers or technicians to perform technician duties as they do on other services? Instead of forcing these tasks on paying 4th year students? Again, it’s not enough, and Dr. Chigerwe has more power than you think to do more. Again, please believe the possibility that I had a different experience than you. Sure, we all know there are faculty who are even worse in their treatment of students and residents, but they are typically well known within a teaching hospital. It is not ironic to call out abuse when it’s seen, particularly if that person is clever at hiding abuse behind outward projections of caring about student and resident health and wellbeing.|Thank you for the context. I’m sure things have improved, maybe more than marginally. Were the errors I saw rare? I don’t know. I’m going to exclude the years I worked as a barn nurse. In my first C barn rotation as a fourth year, a resident microwaved colostrum at high temp, instead of gently warming it in a hot water bath. The calf it was intended for developed failure of passive transfer, and that calf had to be euthanized due to unresolving infections. This resident unfortunately had so many animals die under his care that he had a nickname that included the word “doomsday”. That same rotation, a dairy cow received an extended inappropriate banamine dosage and frequency, and we had to call poison control as part of a CYA to get a treatment plan together to treat the iatrogenic exposure. One of my classmates who was on a following rotation was sliced open by a different resident while they were performing a fetotomy and he had to go to urgent care. A few days later, this same resident accidentally removed a section of a sheep’s colon after failing to identify it as belonging to the GIT and the animal ultimately had to be euthanized. Does this frequency seem like extremely rare occurrences to you? If so, I’d be very concerned about animals under your care when you graduate.Not an error, but looking back on my texts with classmates from that time, another classmate missed several learning opportunities including a goat mastectomy because she was told by Chigerwe that she had to muck out her own patients’ stalls because there wasn’t enough staff to do it. Is that an education?I know it can be hard to have your mentors criticized, so I understand the defensive attitude.

Fortunately, Reddit is a forum that is intended for individuals to share first hand accounts using a (thin) veil of anonymity. I have never spoken in an actual public forum about the very real experiences I had with Dr. Chigerwe and C Barn, which is honestly regrettable.

2083,catanddogtor,2,"GPA is certainly important for some specialties, but the other method to land an internship/residency is networking. But it depends on the specialty of course.I've always been big on work life balance and cruised through vet school with a B average. In my fourth year, I did rotations at locations where I wanted to do an internship and did my best to make a really good impression on the doctors there and was subsequently selected through the match at one of those clinics. During my rotating internship, I did an externship at the clinic where I wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well, and they took me on as a resident outside the match. (Making a good impression basically meant looking into cases ahead of time and being very prepared, knowing about the diseases and medications, jumping in to help as much as possible etc). And now I'm a boarded specialist. Meanwhile, one of my intern-mates was never accepted for residency despite a very high vet school gpa because she was.. well, very awkward.|Also, I went to lots of office hours for a couple different professors, tried very hard to excel on their fourth year rotations (when they occurred before the match) and then asked them for LORs.|I'm not too sure about what grades people are looking for. My resident mate and I both just networked our way into residency outside the match. For dermatology, a good number of the residency positions are outside the match, so you have a couple different avenues for residency. Higher grades are generally helpful for the match, networking is very helpful in or outside the match. Doing a derm internship can make a big difference, because derm is a small world and you can really meet people and learn a lot that way. NAVDF is a good place to network too.",,,,,

2093,Lopsided-Switch-8404,2,"My partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship. I'm in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture, especially when you first join the profession or work at the ""elite"" level. Working long hours because you are in a complex, busy, and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me. What is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians. Some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession, and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment. So many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of ""it was hard for me, and so it should be hard for you."" The point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor, not training, patient care, or gaining experience.This internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns (e.g., an intern can't have more than X number of inpatients at one time; hours limitations related to overnight shifts; etc.) that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis. For example, after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner's inpatients. My partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients. This happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything. This is a common occurrence.Senior clinicians have said blatantly racist things that the interns are afraid to report due to a culture of retaliation.There's an in-house social worker who has repeatedly expressed concerns about intern well being and a culture of abuse and exploitation, and those concerns have been brushed off by leadership repeatedly.There needs to be more oversight of these programs and actual consequences for programs not adhering to their own rules.",,,,,

Unfortunately with that I do less vet assistant work, and more inventory, ordering, and admin work. But I am now making $25/hr in my position. If you’re able to work your way up and take on responsibilities within your clinic, you can potentially increase your pay.

2100,throwawaybutter2023,2,"This depends on your goals (which you do not have to decide upon right away—focus on getting into vet school first!)For starters, most zoos have exotics as part of their program (plenty of zoos have ferrets, rabbits, birds, etc which fall under the ‘exotics’ umbrella because they’re also common in the pet trade).  So if you’re a full time zoo vet, you will be seeing exotics.  But becoming a zoo vet is extremely competitive and difficult, and will require a lot of personal sacrifice.There are also vets in private practice who see exotics.  Some even build up a client base so that they can almost exclusively see exotics.  Some of these vets will volunteer time and resources with small scale zoos who don’t have a full time vet, and that way they can get a small amount of zoo exposure.  Ultimately, zoo and exotics has a lot of crossover.|Thank you for this!!! I did two internships because I was on the speciality path and burnt out.  I was essentially forced to not do a residency because I knew that I wouldn’t survive it with how abysmal my mental health was from my internships.  It is pure BS that universities who make millions a year cannot pay house officers more, and the way house officers are treated is proof that the way these universities preach about “work life balance” and student wellbeing is pure lip service.|Going off of your first point, from the university side I also saw so many specialists leave (either to leave the profession entirely or for private practice).  I experienced the shutdown or near shutdown of multiple speciality services (including dermatology and neurology).  Not only was this concerning from a lack of teaching resources and patient care, it was frankly insulting and traumatic to residents.  I knew multiple residents who, after working their asses off to get to that residency, were forced to watch their programs dissolve and have to move to a different state to be patched in to some other universities residency.  This was also devastating to interns who were interested in that speciality and suddenly no longer had that service or letter of reference available.  I think this profession is actively destroying its specialists and I fully agree—we won’t have enough specialists in the near future.|Another intern quit during my second internship and the overall tone about their quitting was very negative and that they were basically “too weak to cut it.”  I agree, these systems shut you down from being able to speak out.|I’ll also add that even becoming a specialist isn’t a guarantee of significant wage increase, especially if you’re on the university side.  Many specialists in academia are making less than what most GPs are making.  This is driving a lot of specialists out of education (and for many, out of the field entirely).  I’ve also talked to financial planners who say that you don’t truly financially recover from the 4-5+ years of lost potential revenue while doing internship and residency, even if you become a specialist with higher wages compared to GPs.  You simply cannot make up for that many years of abysmal pay when you could’ve been making six figures with your DVM.|Just a small thing I found that’s helped some new(er) graduates I’ve worked with—are you at a clinic full time?  If so, do they have the means to subsidize the cost of radiology reviews for you?  I’ve worked at clinics that cover the cost of radiology reviews (often within the x ray cost) or at least partly offset it so you can get a radiologist opinion on most or all of the images you take.  I feel like that’s super helpful because you can still try interpretation on your own, get a radiologist’s final say, and often those services can offer consultation calls for more detailed discussion.|Got very close to leaving three years out.  Did two internships followed by a year in GP.  Was horrifically burnt out and miserable, and on the verge of leaving vet med entirely, so I left to do relief with tentative plans to move to mobile euthanasia, lab animal, or anything else that offers decent pay without being a GP full time.  Had a few classmates who did similarly.  Unfortunately in my experience, leaving entirely is quite hard because it’s rare to match the salary you can attain with your doctorate.|So far, very enjoyable!  I like making my own schedule and the pay is quite good.  However, you sacrifice benefits being covered for you such as health insurance (I was able to enroll in my partners), PLIT, disability, etc, so those can incur pretty high out-of-pocket costs.  You will also have to pay higher quarterly income taxes as an independent contractor.  And of course, no PTO—you’ll have to work extra to save accordingly if you want time off.  I personally don’t like having to plan these things for myself or the idea of hiring someone to do it, so I am only doing relief until something full time plays out.  I know lots of folk who have been in relief for a long time and LOVE it, but it’s not free of downsides.  And I’m wondering how you found a job in government!  I’ve been looking but haven’t found any leads—maybe I’m looking in the wrong places?|Seconding the animal control point -- don't forget, as a vet you're a mandatory reporter in most states.  If you feel that the animal is suffering and is being deprived of appropriate medical care, it is within your rights to contact animal control.  I feel that this isn't necessary or applicable in the majority of cases, but it is always within your reach.|I’m gonna lay it out honestly to you, OP, as I just left a hospital with extremely similar circumstances.  A hospital that is as far gone as yours will take a lot more than a new MD to turn around—my prior hospital took on an excellent new MD and despite all of her efforts, nothing changed.  This hospital has a deeply ingrained culture issue, and it’s not worth the sacrifice to your mental or physical health (or the risk to your license) to try to stick it through this circus.  Best choice I ever made was leaving and I would think about doing just that.|I second this!!! Also Stoskopf’s fish medicine and if you are into invertebrates, Lewbart’s Invertebrate Medicine|Agree with many of the comments below.  I was on the path to be a wildlife/zoo veterinarian, and ended up leaving that path because of the INCREDIBLE intensity of post graduate training and low pay involved.  Wildlife is one of the most competitive fields of vet med and you will not be paid well.  Also -- there are some things in wildlife that you might not find ethically doable.  Sometimes you need to cull wildlife for population control or infectious disease management.  Sometimes you will need care for wildlife that is being kept captive for research projects (which may include things like artificial insemination, inoculating those animals with disease, etc).  Even in small animal medicine, there are ugly realities of cruelty and neglect that you will encounter on a regular basis -- and a legal system that isn't always the most caring or attentive regarding animal cruelty.  You will HAVE to learn about large animal and production medicine in veterinary school.  In my opinion, liking animals is not a good reason to become a vet.  No matter what field you're in, the majority of your job with be interacting with people and not animals.

2136,Is-thisthing-on,2,"Current UCD 4th year here! I had the pleasure of tracking livestock and being able to work closely with Dr. Chigerwe as a student technician in C barn as well as over my third and fourth year and feel the need to speak up for a very well respected colleague and mentor. Dr C has worked as a mentor to students throughout their 4years of vet school, beginning with orientation and taking on a mentor group each year as well as until recently working in a position where he worked specifically within the curriculum to ensure that students had adequate work life balance and places to report learning climate incidents to ensure that students felt heard and safe as they learned. Working with students on clinics, Dr. C has advocated the most for students and residents to have time off of any clinician I have worked with. In fact, he called me personally the day after I stayed at the hospital until 4am working on an emergency to tell me to take an extra few hours off past the 6 we are typically allowed to ensure that I was well rested. As far as the long work hours, I don’t think it’s fair to say that this is something that he specifically is responsible for. UCD has one of, if not the, largest caseloads of any vet school in the country, particularly for livestock (which is something I would expect you to know as an alumni). The unfortunate reality of the Livestock Medicine and Surgery service is that they are three services in one. They must manage scheduled appointments, in-patients, surgeries, and emergencies with one team. This means that one weeks when it is extremely busy or when there are outside circumstances (such as a major wildfire), the service is incredibly busy and there is simply no one else to take cases or help manage inpatients. The school does their best to help with this by shuffling technicians to other services when they are swamped or having underclassmen or off duty clinicians volunteer their time when necessary to relieve the burden, but this is not a perfect solution. I absolutely agree with the post author that the overworking of residents and interns is a serious problem within this field, and remain hopeful that solutions can be proposed in the next few years. I do think it is unprofessional to single out a specific clinician as a villain in what is most best described as a systemic problem. I am very sorry that you had such a negative experience, but want to provide a different view of the person you have singled out here.|For large animal, we still provide 8am and 8pm treatments. We are allowed to have 6hrs off of clinics after being on call if we are called in during the night, a policy that Chigerwes specifically advocated for. I agree that people do need to be held accountable in order to make things change, I just find it ironic that you singled out Dr. C when he has been one of the loudest voices advocating for students and residents. My only intention is to stick up for a mentor that has stuck up for me multiple times throughout my curriculum. There are many other clinicians I have worked with who are much more blasé about students and residents needs, and I think this is the mentality that needs to be changed. The balance between being a “go-getter” and someone who prioritizes work life balance is a hard road to find, especially in livestock medicine, and I do appreciate you opening up that conversation. I hope that UCD and many other vet schools pay attention to the national conversation around interns and residents in the future and figure out administrative ways to make sure that everyone gets the experience they want while also ensuring that they are mentally and physically rested!|This will be my last reply as I think I’ve done what I originally intended (provide much needed context for non UCD individuals who might read this) and don’t see the point in going in circles with you when you’ve clearly made up your own mind. They have hired a new RVT every single year that I have been in vet school (since 2020), hire new student technicians every year, and have a treatment crew that comes to assist with AM and PM treatments each day (who are paid). They are opening up positions for interns in multiple services next year (who have very competitive salaries compared to other similar positions, you can check the match if you don’t believe me) to help distribute the on call schedule even more and reduce the burden on an individual. Granted, I don’t know how many of these changes are directly due to Dr. C, but he has been a vocal proponent of implementing them around the entire hospital and ensuring they are upheld, even as many other faculty grumbled about them. My experience with the person you’re implying is trying to deceive us all is making sure that students and residents eat, checking to make sure they got sleep, and even buying food for the entire service on busy days. He has been caring, checks in frequently with everyone, and takes his own cases without residents or interns if they already have too many in-patients (something no other LA faculty do that I’ve seen. And sure, 6hrs off is by no means perfect but it’s a hell of a lot better than nothing! It’s impossible to snap our fingers and fix things at any school, but I think that this is a great step in the right direction. I would also love to know if there are any veterinary students out there who can honestly say that they got 8hrs of sleep every night on every service at any school (I doubt it). I personally have never seen or heard of a medical error of the nature you described, and have to conclude that’s an extreme exception rather than your comment making it seem almost commonplace. It seems as if your experience was extremely different from my own, my classmates, and the classmates I overlapped with who have already graduated. I don’t think that publicly shaming someone who has already been making efforts to create change (and who was first author on that article for goodness sakes!) in a forum of peers is an appropriate way to create the change you say you want. I think your energy would be better used focusing on those that have made efforts AGAINST change (I can think of a few!). I also think you should reflect on the professionalism of posting your original comment at all, honestly. Again, I’m not trying to say that your experience wasn’t real, it probably was, but I believe that you are putting way too much blame on one person, and especially a person who has been actively taking steps to address the issues you bring up. Wishing you the best with your career and life!",,,,,
2137,HumanProject7893,2,"Hey! I did a graduate programme with V4P and I have to say the training is very good, definitely worth it. However, the downside of this programme (and most of new grad programmes I know from corporates) is that the actual CPDs/training are quite scarce in the sense that you'll do one every couple of months (roughly). The training has a good quality but they give it to you in small sporadic doses so that you have to stick with them during those 2 years, not that it takes 2 years to do that training at all lol. You'd be able to do it in 1-2 months if anything.So it was overall a good quality programme and a nice extra if you're just planning to do GP for a while with no rush, but if you were thinking of maybe doing a certificate or an internship (these programmes are NOT an internship) etc I'd tell you to do the certificate at the same time with the new grad programme (totally doable time-wise) or do an internship directly.Edit: with scarce I mean that I wish they were done more often, not that the content is not enough. The practical CPDs were particularly good too",,,,,
2138,Turamnab,2,"Try working as a vet assistant or kennel tech at a clinic or hospital. From there, find out if what you want is to be a veterinarian or a vet tech. Techs, in my experience, work more with patients than clients, whereas the doctors are about 60/40, leaning toward clients.If you go the tech route you can make an okay living if you know where to look. If you specialize, you won't be wealthy but you can make a little more than the average cost of living in a lot of areas. Doctors make more of course, but they can easily find themselves in a lifetime of debt. The schooling is a pretty massive undertaking as well. Certified techs can be paid off in a couple of years, have school that can be juggled with full time work (especially if you work at a clinic), and in many cases you can ""graduate"" with no debt at all.Best of luck :)",,,,,

2158,Fattestcattest1990,2,Completely agreed. I worked for a corporate and they priced themselves out so far that clients had to pay for their care plans to afford care. So clients had a monthly payment instead of having to pay a much higher one time cost for an annual. However you as the vet receive a significantly smaller commission on their care plans compared to clients on no plan. So it screwed the vets. You better believe they priced it that way on purpose so it’s a win win for them - make more on the client or pay the vet less. Either way the corporate gets more money in their pocket.|I worked for a private hospital and the doctor said to “ignore” the section written about negative accrual on my contract.

The only thing I can think of where invoices could run high with some regularity would be dental procedures, but even those should have a wide range on the estimate because we know that we don’t have a complete idea of what needs to be done until the animal is anesthetized and the rads are done, and the invoice should still fall within the higher end of the range. When these bills come in over the estimate, does the practice owner discuss this with the client before they come in to pay, or, even better, before the extra charges are incurred? They should definitely not be leaving this conversation for receptionists or technicians to have with clients. If your hours are being cut because the practice is slow, I would look for another job.

2187,omegasavant,2,"Some schools, Illinois being one of them, have steep grade cutoffs for OOS applicants. In general, it's a bad idea to get attached to a specific school. Applying for vet school means that you'll be throwing darts at a board. Every AVMA-accredited vet school has similar standards and a similar curriculum. There are no reach schools, no safety schools, and no guarantee that *any* application will happen to get the admissions committee's interest. Once you have an application that you're confident in, apply as widely as you can and go to the cheapest AVMA accredited school to accept you.|OOS standards are higher due to the sheer number of applications received. Most states have one vet school or none. If you're applying to 10 schools, nine of those applications are out of state. Everyone else does the same thing, and it gets worse every year.Many schools have specific slots reserved for IS applicants. And they charge exorbitantly for OOS, since there's no state subsidization--which means you might end up paying twice or three times as much for the same education.I recommend that you do some careful, thorough reading about how the application process works before you spend thousands applying. Some schools give in-state tuition after a year. Some schools have 3.8-4.0 cutoffs. Some are likely too expensive to be worth it even if you're in-state (looking at you, Tufts). Go comb through the schools' websites. Check in advance for weird pre-req requirements that might disqualify you. Similarly, make sure your pre-req GPA is high enough for those schools that use that as a metric. Seriously consider whether you need a Master's or post-bacc work to be competitive. And figure out if you're willing to take on the risk of an island school.If you don't have good answers for those questions and don't have a concrete plan, take some time off before you apply.|I was an ACO in southern Texas before getting into vet school. I would've killed to have a resource like you at our disposal. Apologies for the length of the post and don't take offense if you're already tracking on some of the issues I talk about here.First and foremost: it is difficult to stress how little it takes to make a difference in the quality of life for some of these animals.  They're getting fed inconsistently or living off table scraps. Is there a pet food bank where you live? What would be required to set one up?Half the ones that *are* getting fed aren't keeping that nutrition due to worm burden. Pyrantel is cheap and safe. If I'd been in charge we would have had a bottle in the back of every truck. Instead we counseled people to go to the vet. They're never going to the vet: the exam fee alone is a day's pay, maybe two. So animals die for want of 30 cents of dewormer.They're not vaccinated. Not for rabies, not for parvo. Literally anything helps. Immunity in adults can last for something like 7 years, per recent studies. I'm not saying you should vaccinate your dog, specifically, every 7 years, but you can make a dent in a population-level problem even if it's done inconsistently. Puppy vaccines are more complicated, but your neighbors know what parvo is, they know puppies die from it, and they will prevent it if they know how. Spend ten minutes talking about it--odds are good you're the first person to have had that conversation with them. I don't have a good solution for the heartworm problem. Most of these dogs will get it eventually, and even if you use proheart you need to at least see these animals once a year. If you have the budget to do HW testing and proheart, though, you can at least make a dent.They're on a chain in the backyard. Trolley systems are 10 bucks and can give that animal the whole yard, instead of getting strangled on a post. Or dying in the summer because they got tangled up and can't reach the water bowl. Fixed tethers were actually illegal in my jurisdiction, so we spent a lot of time giving those out and getting them set up. (Though you do have to set it up--it's just difficult enough to figure out that if you don't, there'll be an unwrapped trolley on the porch whenever you're called back to that house.)They're not *owned*. By the time I wrapped up, I came to the conclusion that there isn't a single genuine stray dog in the whole city. Shelters are full of dumped animals, and their already-thin budgets are covering pets that should be at home with their owners. How do you help with that? Microchips. Microchip puppies while they're small and cute. Give your shelter options when those animals get dumped five years later. You also do get some striking reunion stories out of this. I've reunited people with pets that had gotten out of a fence a decade earlier. Finally--there's a lot you can do by just casting a wide net. Ask for help and do it without an ounce of shame. My shelter had a list of rescues and nonprofits that a had a variety of resources at their disposal. Some of them specialized in injured animals, some in aggressive animals, some in specific breeds. A lot of them had nationwide coverage, generally with a headquarters somewhere up north. See if there's any names on that list who could either help with a spay/neuter effort or direct you to an organization that can. You're not the first people to want to set up a new spay/neuter clinic, and I suspect you'll be able to get good advice on the logistics from people who've done it before. Bother your city, too. Do they know that there's a bunch of vet students chomping at the bit to help with their dog problem? Remind them that they have that resource at their disposal and ask, politely but firmly, if they can help you help them.|I agree with ""something not vet-related"". Get them something that's related to a hobby they cared about in the Before Times, before they got in--art supplies, a nice book, what have you. The best thing you can get them is a reminder that they're still human.",,,,,

Do whatever you can to keep your debt low. Go to the cheapest school (usually your in state), work for scholarships, and live within your means especially while a student. It’s life changing not to have the $100k+ cloud hanging over me like some colleagues have. The next two points are all about where you choose to work. Before you take a job, spent time there (ideally several days or weeks) just seeing how it works and how everyone gets along. Find a clinic that appreciates you and understands your mental health and happiness are critical to their production. That means ensuring you aren’t overbooked, you have mentorship, support staff are component and also happy, bad clients get fired, and you’re compensated fairly for your work.

But even if you consider another job, don't think that it has to be business or finance or something unrelated to your passions. Think about what you are actually interested in, and look at alternative careers related to that. Do you like medicine, biology, science in general? Could you be interested in some kind of science not directly related to animals, or related to animals but in a different way?

If not then you need to figure out what metrics they’re using to determine the cutoff for interviews and improve that. If she’s getting interviews and no offers then you have to look at coaching for interviewing.

I’ve been in practice for 20 years, own a hospital, and finally have enough staff to consider what I actually want. I looked hard into a non-traditional residency. I wrote letters, actually found mentors, the whole nine yards.The further I got in the process, the more uncomfortable it felt. The program was going to take 4-5 years; like you, I‘m not near a university, so the entire time away was like 28 non-consecutive weeks. Not terrible, but something to be considered.i began to wonder if that amount of academia was what I really wanted. I think I finally realized I wanted something more in my life-  but board certification wasn’t it. I actually became a firefighter and EMT-it’s been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.   Maybe a residency at a specialty practice would be far more tolerable to someone who’s been in the real world for a while.   Yes, it's possible, and I’m sure you can do it. No, it’s not crazy. I think if you can practice for at least ten years a a boarded radiologist, then the time investment pencils.

I thinks it’s part of the profession that we mentor new graduates. They need it, and they need someone who’s present In the same facility.|&#x200B;I misspoke by using the word “need,” I agree. But again, I’m not sure why you think a power dynamic is such an inevitable conclusion to a mentorship. For twenty years, my hospital has had interns, new grads, relatively new grads and support staff who all needed mentorship or collaborative advice.I think perhaps we have a different view of mentorship. To me, it’s a vet on site who helps you m make medical and surgical decisions in real time. Mentorship can also help with the pressures and daily ups and downs of the profession. Having a mentor nearby the first time something detrimental happens with a patient is a very, very valuable thing. If I had a new grad who had an off site mentor and kept calling them on the phone all day, I would certainly feel like the employee’s attention was divided. It would be an absurd system.   Most veterinary schools have ample resources for help with contract negotiation. To your other point, an “ethical situation that they’re not ready for their boss to know about:” yikes. When do they discuss it with their boss? After they’ve covered it up? Spoken to resources outside the hospital and broken confidentiality?   Again, we have quite different ideas about mentorship. I’m curious ; where are you in your career?   Also, could you expound on the nature of the “power dynamic?”|I’m not an attorney, but I suspect the charge isn’t as important as the sentence; if you’re convicted of a felony, it may be difficult to get a DEA, and many employers draw the line at that conviction.

If you can tough out the emotions, the rewards are everything. From what I know, you get to know your patients deeply after caring for them every day.

2315,marchbanks273,1,"Hey OP,I have also gone through what you're going through. I had minimal vet experience before and through my degree, and COVID ruined my final year placements as a 2020 grad (they became online school instead). I came out as a veterinarian that had little knowledge and skill and as a result I suffered so much anxiety and imposter syndrome. It got to the point where I became scared of doing any consult where the patient was mildly sick and I almost left the industry.I'm now three years out and at a teaching hospital teaching final year students, and it's cool to see how far I've come. What helped me was a supportive environment while I found my confidence. Vomiting cases more complicated than a maropitant injection used to terrify me, especially if they came back the next day. Now I actively enjoy the puzzle of figuring out the next steps instead of reacting with fear. I have coworkers that love to contribute their thoughts and are there to support me when things still don't go right. Even if you make a mistake, then the least you can do is make it a learning experience for yourself so that the next patient you encounter will benefit from what you've learned. I still get anxious time to time, and I think my first year as a new grad was not great for my imposter syndrome but time and experience has helped me so much with my nerves. You should never too be hard on yourself as a new grad - I'm sure the past you in early DVM would be very proud of the things you've achieved as a veterinarian, and when you're a seasoned vet you'll also look back on how far you've come. All the best!|I'm an ER vet as well and I personally found this to be more useful over Thrall and radiology CE for my learning. Our clinic uses VetCT and when submitting radiographs you can ask specific questions you want answered. I usually have a go interpreting it myself and then you can get direct feedback from a radiologist. You have the option of discussing it further with them if required. I like it because they'll label where in the radiograph they see the pathology. I don't usually need them to come to a diagnosis but it's really helpful in situations like you described about wanting to know the subtle part of the radiographs, without needing to be awake in the day to speak to a radiologist.",,,,,

PDS (polydioxannone) last a longggg time (50% tensile strength in 6 weeks and complete absorption in 6 months). so it's great for fascia, not so great for intradermals. not bad per se, but not great. for dog spays, i will happily use two packs of suture (PDS for the pedicles/uterus and body wall and monocryl for sub and skin). however, for cat spays, as i only tie three ligatures, i will put PDS in the skin bc that's a waste to open two packs.   and just to add confusion,  i actually use biosyn (gylcomer 631) and maxon (polyglyconate), coviden's answer to monocryl and PDS, respectively. biosyn gives you three weeks before 50% of the tensile strength is lost, and maxon has the same dissolution characteristics (though it's not as ""smooth"") as PDS. and maxon actually has better knot security by a small margin compared to PDS). one of the big reasons why i use these sutures in my clinic is the cost. these are human-grade sutures, unlike that cheap-ass generic PDS and monocryl (like one-dox, one-cryl, etc). i hate that generic shit- the cartridges suck and lock up, the dye comes off on your cloves. it's really shitty suture. AND biosyn and maxon are often the same price, or cheaper as the knock off pds/monocryl. &#x200B;hope that helps|i think they put the fear of gut into you so you don't use it on the body wall. it will fall apart way too fast for something that needs strength for a long time (fascia). but for ligation of vessels- totally fine. it even incites a little inflammatory reaction as it's broken down to make a more ""secure"" ligation.  i don't use it myself, but again, for simple vessel ligation, there's nothing wrong with it.|not appropriate for the body wall, absolutely. ask yourself- how long does a ligature on a few vessels NEED to be there? 6 months (as with PDS)? no.and they still sell it, even on the human side. it's not poison.  what about polilgactin 910 (vicryl)? it's super soft, and i love it in oral mucosa for that very reason, but it doesn't last long.  it would be inappropriate to put it in the body wall (just like gut). using the wrong suture in the wrong location is like prescribing the wrong med for a condition. you need to know your tools and where they go. that's when you get in trouble.",,,,,

To your below comment, I would not recommend manipulating your ligature nor suture with instruments more than necessary to tie the knots. Messing around with the knot seems like a great way to weaken or dislodge it. I agree grabbing the cut section above the ligatures (are you double ligating?) is more appropriate. Many HQHVSN docs recommend using a modified Millers or similar for best tightening down ability. For the uterine body slip, transfixing ligatures can be used too. All in all, I would definitely recommend practicing your knot tying outside of live surgeries.

We had 2 people in our year from North America, both had biological science degrees with honours postgrads but both had to start in 1st year (and I’m sure you’re aware it’s a 6 year course with the first year basically being just non vet sciences). Once you complete your BVSc, to practice in SA you need to complete a compulsory community service year and you only can do it in the year after you graduated. No comserve = no council registration.You can use the degree to practice in the UK, AUS and NZ without comserve.OP is definitely a planet of its own. It’s in a very isolated part of town and some people struggle with that, especially in residence.

It’s definitely tough and a distinction is 75% (in the old days it used to be 65% but honestly the way they test it might as well be!). Admin tends to be on the disorganised side and you often get told of important things the day before (sometimes even the morning of!). And the exam paper setting - my mother is a medical professor and when I told her about some of them she would just gawp in astonishment. It’s not very standardised but hey suppose it makes you think in the fifth dimensionSpecies wise - expect a lot of ruminant theory  work. Majority of the theory is focused on ruminants throughout the modules. We do have dedicated smallies and equines modules. Wildlife is a very small one semester module in 5th year and exotics is an elective week during clinics. Majority of clinics was smallies rotations as that keeps the hospital ticking over financially.Clinics are a very vigorous 18 months. The 1 week of ICU night shift rotation is infamous. Like anywhere there are good clinicians and bad clinicians. They do get away quite easily if they aren’t the nicest person to students. But for the most part they do their jobs really well and are good clinicians. But yeah doing the NAVLE if you want to go back to America to practice should be definitely on your mind. It’s an expensive test and I think for the SA guys (I was looking into it at a point but decided naaah) was about $10 000. Maybe it will be less if you have American degrees but the majority of the cost was the veterinary testing the and practical exams. Hope this helps - you definitely need to make this an informed decision and weigh up the reasons for going to SA.

Make sure you apply for EAEVE accredited schools, it doesn’t matter which tbh, after that if you want to work in the US or Canada, you have to sit the NAVLE, that’s pretty much it. If you want to work in the UK, you only need to apply for equivalence with RCVS, no statutory exam required, I personally did that in less than 1 month. I personally don’t understand why anyone would be willing to have this amount of debt that might go on for years and add to the chances of burn out, there are alternatives. The schools are not free of course, and they are 6 year programs usually (some 5.5years) so if you have an undergraduate you might be able to exempt a few course maybe but you will probably need to start and do full years.

Among these visits, five consultative site evaluations are slated for proposed veterinary programs vying for accreditation.  The consultative site visit serves as a crucial step for proposed veterinary colleges, offering them an unofficial report on their readiness to apply for a letter of reasonable assurance. Once deficiencies are addressed, institutions can proceed with a comprehensive site visit to determine eligibility for a letter of reasonable assurance—a pivotal milestone allowing them to begin enrolling students.  These initiatives underscore the AVMA COE's commitment to fostering excellence in veterinary education and advancing the profession. Among the notable institutions undergoing evaluation is the Rowan University Shreiber School of Veterinary Medicine, with a comprehensive site visit scheduled for April 21-26. The program aims to enroll its inaugural class in fall 2025, pending accreditation.  Additionally, consultative site visits are slated for prominent institutions such as Clemson University’s proposed College of Veterinary Medicine and Arkansas State University’s proposed College of Veterinary Medicine. These visits, scheduled for May 12-16 and July 7-11, respectively, reflect the growing demand for accredited veterinary programs across the nation.  Another noteworthy addition to the accreditation pipeline is Chamberlain University's proposed School of Veterinary Medicine in Stockbridge, Georgia. Set for a consultative visit from August 11-15, the program aims to expand access to veterinary medicine education and address future workforce needs in the field.  Furthermore, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is set to embark on a transformative journey with its proposed veterinary school. Scheduled for a consultative site visit from July 7-11, UMES aims to become the second historically Black college and university (HBCU) to offer a standalone veterinary program, following in the footsteps of Tuskegee University.  Meanwhile, Rocky Vista University (RVU) has unveiled plans for its proposed College of Veterinary Medicine in Billings, Montana. The program, set for a consultative site visit from July 21-25, represents a significant milestone in RVU's commitment to expanding access to veterinary education.  Lastly, Hanover College in Indiana is poised to launch a revolutionary hybrid accelerated veterinary program, pending accreditation. Backed by a $5.9 million grant from Indiana, the program seeks to revolutionize veterinary education by offering a blend of online lectures, hands-on laboratory experiences, and distributed clinical education opportunities.|How to navigate the ECFG program   Enroll in the ECFVG program, provide proof of graduation, and verify veterinary college credentials.

2393,watermelon-milkshake,2,"I’m going to have to agree with those saying OP is making generalizations based on one person’s bad experience in vet school and not based on a real general consensus.Generally speaking, my instructors and classmates in vet school could not have been less toxic. Certainly there were instructors who had bad attitudes and/or sometimes set unreasonable standards for students to meet, but those were few and far between and you learn how to navigate their presence. For the most part everyone recognizes how challenging this profession is and help with concepts and support from classmates abound.Perfectionism is rampant among veterinary professionals but most people get pretty good at managing these tendencies once they’ve been out of vet school for a year or two. Once you’ve been in the “real world” practicing as a licensed doctor you will quickly learn that it is impossible to be perfect and you are only hurting your own mental health in trying to be so.Speaking as a wildlife veterinarian, there is absolutely no way that any veterinary school could provide classes that go deep into topics on every taxonomic group (and still manage to cover all the important anatomy/physiology/pharmacology/medicine topics required for medicine in any species) and I’m glad they don’t try. Dog, cat, cow, and horse medicine is the bread and butter of veterinary schools because most people who are there will be primarily working on these species, and those who won’t will base much of the medicine they practice on the concepts learned about these species. I would never be able to work on a tiger if I weren’t comfortable with house cat medicine. The same goes for avian/fish/herps/etc. - most of what we do with these groups is based on what we know about domestic species. There are many schools which do provide excellent training opportunities (didactic courses, rotations, research experience) for those with special interest in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics, and even if your school does not provide much of this you still have the opportunity to gain experience while in school through externships and/or summer jobs and attending conventions. This is also a great way to network as training programs and jobs in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics/aquaculture are among the most highly competitive and making connections is a good way to break down some of these barriers. The “real” training to prepare you for being comfortable with working on nondomestic species is through internship and residency. And even the 4+ years of specialized post-doc training requires much discipline and drive to study outside of your clinical responsibility (on your days off) in order to be prepared to sit boards to specialize. In short - this lack of experience is on you. Sorry.Yes, there are many ignorant people who do not see veterinarians as “real doctors”. This should have come as no surprise. There are plenty of jobs where you do not face this sort of speculation regularly, and it’s your choice to let this bother you anyway. If I concerned myself with the opinions of all the ignorant people who speculate about my occupation I would go absolutely mad. The people who matter will see you as a “real doctor”, I promise. I work many long days (and nights and weekends). The reality of the schedules worked by many veterinarians also should not have come as a surprise to you. If you are considering working in a field like aquatics or aquaculture, much like in the rest of the zoo/wildlife/exotics world you will absolutely be expected to take some on-call shifts and work weekends throughout your specialty training and career. Depending on your job you may be working with high-profile animals (or those considered food animals) in which case many ailments are considered emergencies, meaning you have some long days ahead of you. However, even in jobs where nights or weekends are worked, a healthy work/life balance is absolutely achievable. It just takes practice and good time management skills. Having to write records at home varies from job to job but I would argue that this is less often the case and largely depends on the individual. I’m actually not allowed to write records at home in my current position. Some of my friends who practice elsewhere write records at home and many do not.I’m sorry you’ve had such a negative experience in school. Vet school can be challenging in many ways, but it does not have to be like this forever.  Being a veterinarian offers ample opportunity to have a successful career in a variety of fields.

You need to ask the clinic what they project your production for that clinic will be when you are out of the “internship” style start.

This means that a.) a significant portion of my cohort is a lot younger than me (im 25 now!!) and b.) the degree is structured in such a way that if you don’t perform well in the first semester (the pre-selection phase), you won’t advance in the program. This can add a lot of stress to the first semester, especially if you’re uprooting your whole adult life to move countries ( l o l ). The program is also 5 years long, instead of the standard 4 years. That being said, I’m really happy I came here. I’ve met several students who are also older (people up in their late 30’s !!) and it seems like we all kind of flock together. The courses are rigorous, but if you’ve done any uni before and understand time management, etc. they’re very doable. The cost of attendance after converting from USD to NZD is lower per year than out of state tuition to US vet schools, but paying for the 5th year of the program means that you’ll probably graduate with about the same amount of debt as an out-of-state US program. Right now I feel confident that I’ll be moving forward in the program, but if for whatever reason I’m not selected I would probably be singing a different tune. Do lots of research, and don’t be afraid to reach out to uni advisors with whatever questions youmay have about their programs. I also definitely second the advice of getting some hands on vet med experience before you decide anything final. Whatever you decide, good luck !!|At least for Massey, you only apply via their internal system! Getting into the pre-selection semester is pretty easy, but moving on in the program is more difficult. There are 2 tests and some interviews you have take during your first semester, on top of a pretty full course load. The university won’t tell us how many international students there are applying to get past the pre-selection semester, but they did let us know there are 50 places available for international students. Apparently last year, when there were 39 or so places available, every international student who qualified was offered a seat.",,,,,

It is a long journey. The bare minimum requirements to become a boarded surgeon are achieving your DVM, one year of a rotating internship after vet school graduation, and a 3-year residency. This is easier said than done, and it's not uncommon to have to do multiple internships (known as specialty internships, these would be one year programs that are surgery focused) before getting a residency. During your surgery residency you will be required to take two board exams, and you have to publish at least one paper in a veterinary journal. It's never too early to start gaining surgical experience. A good place to start would be a local shelter that does high volume spay/neuters; they're typically always looking for volunteers. If you have any additional questions I'd be happy to answer.|Not a dumb question. As a rule of thumb it is not ideal. Usually 30-60k a year. It depends on where you go.

It’s very expensive and then you would have to buy it again when it’s time to actually take the NAVLE. You’re still very fresh and new to vet school and many of the topics on VetPrep will go over your head at this stage in your education. Your class notes and labs are enough to study right now. However, you can sign up for the VetPrep question of the day email subscription if you’d like to know what the questions look like before purchasing at the end of your 3rd year.|Small animal GP!|I used VetPrep and only got ~40% through it, but I did go through all of the powerpages twice and watched every single powerlecture at least once. After my first self assessment (I did 2 and my 2nd one’s high end was very close to my score), I saw I needed to do better on my feline and equine questions, so I spent 2 weeks studying powerpages and powerlectures and comparing them to my class notes to fill in any gaps for equine and cats. During those 2 weeks, I just did practice questions for all other species. Then I spent 2 more weeks on cats and reviewed dogs at the same time. Then I spent 2 weeks on bovine and reviewed horses at the same time. I mainly focused on the big 4 categories. Then the last 2 weeks I had of studying, I integrated exotics, pigs, poultry, and miscellaneous stuff like how to calculate sensitivity and specificity etc. into my study plan but continued to review the big 4 via questions and powerpages. Now, for these 8 weeks, I was on externships, electives, or off so I had a LOT of time to study (~5-8 hours a day). Another tid bit: my 2nd year I started to have crippling test anxiety where I would just freeze up and forget things, so I’ve been on medication for that ever since. If you feel it’s not just the way you studied but the way you take the exam, no shame in talking to a doctor for some medical help! Hope this was insightful and good luck!!!",,,,,

2513,rememberjanuary,2,"While money should be the main factor in considering a school, you need to also realize that if you don't accept this school, you may never get an acceptance to vet school in the future.|Being a veterinarian is a good career, but you have to be in it pretty much 100%. If you're not, it will suck your soul out of you. It still might even if it's everything you've ever wanted it to be. If you can't see yourself doing anything else then do it, but recognize it has a lot of downsides too (just as any career).The first thing is definitely the income to debt ratio. I'm in Canada and my debt to income ratio after graduating was approximately 1:1. That's manageable. But in the US where it can often be 3:1 or even 4:1, you need to seriously consider things. Salaries are getting better but it's no physician salary, not even close. Some specialists can make 300k plus, but as someone in residency right now that is a LOT of work.The second thing is that this career is emotionally taxing. It asks that you give all of your emotional self to others. Giving it to your patients is great and you can really see their appreciation when you help them. But not all clients are as grateful, agreeable, or available. Vet med has a high attrition rate.If you do consider vet med seriously consider careers outside general practice. It may not be your ideal career working for government, or food safety, or epidemiology, but salaries are still quite good and you don't have as many stresses, or at least not the same kind.I will say that the DVM is an incredibly useful degree and I've been privileged enough to have some wonderful experiences through my training and met some amazing people. But you need to consider the whole picture. In fact, if you do consider applying, this kind of knowledge is going to make you a more attractive candidate in interviews.Best of luck!|I think you'll find the cost comparable to most OOS school tuition in the US. And sometimes it's easier to get into too, just because not everyone considers them. There are two schools in Canada offering non citizens spots: OVC and AVC. WCVM may be now as well. Montreal does but is only in French.|Veterinary medicine is the kind of career that doesn't end when the work day ends. You bring a lot of that home with you. Sometimes it's actual work, reports and case logs, and other times it is mental anguish.It also is not worth it if you're going to school in the USA and pay obscene amounts of tuition. The pay just isn't high enough to justify the debt. And the debt also plays a role in mental health.I had OCD going into vet school and I really struggled with balancing study and my mental health and at one point I was at my lowest ever mental health point.I've switched directions in vet med now to diagnostics and it's a much better balance, but still a huge time commitment.In some ways I wish animals were still my hobby or their only purpose was companionship.You can certainly make it through vetmed and have a fulfilling life but I don't think most people can do that and still have good mental health. Even in residency there are days off where I just sleep the whole day. That's not really living.You'll find a career you enjoy enough, but is also financially viable.|Yeah the DVM is a stupid useful degree. And after 300-400k in debt you are going to put yourself and your family in incredible economic hardship.|That's definitely a hardship and I'm sorry you have to bear it.

Hospice care just means your treatment goals change from pursuing a cure to pursuing comfort and quality of life - whatever that means for the specific pet and the family (usually aggressive symptom management but also home modifications and other things). Hospice care guidelines state it is our duty as veterinarians to provide this service when it is warranted or refer to someone who can.|I guess I would also add, don't worry too much about specializing at this point.

I started working at a small animal vet hospital, being the only assistant on a very small staff with one vet, and I cried and cried after every euthanasia. As I matured and grew into the field, I realized that veterinary medicine is absolutely beautiful, and awesome, and hard, and so special, and it has so many different avenues. So if you do decide to enter vet med, that could mean becoming a vet, or maybe specializing, or being a tech, or traveling, or whatever! It’s so versatile, and that’s another reason why I love it. Every time I get to go to work and sit with a horse while it heals, or walk up to a previously very sick dog’s cage with its tail wagging like crazy, I am reminded that little me knew what she was doing!

I make the equivalent of $49k which is considered a fairly good salary for a non-specialised vet, so when I see vets making twice that just starting out (plus production however much that is) it does sound weird.But then I remember that the average student debt for vets in the US is almost triple mine and I don't need to pay for health insurance etc. So it probably evens out.

I think he bought all the supplies from a farm store. Then the dog started chewing the area so he (maybe asked for medical advice at that point) and he put a cone around the dog’s neck. Low and  behold his daughter couldn’t keep up with the puppy and they gave him away and the people who took him just assumed he was vaccinated because he was “fixed.” I wonder if they lived within city limits and tried to get him a dog license. If they lived outside of city limits a lot of people in the rural area I grew up in don’t bother to seek veterinary care for “farm animals” unless the animal gets sick although dogs are more likely cared for than cats or other animals.

None require state licenses, licensing examinations, continuing education (legally), etc. There are some more respected societies, such as American Veterinary Society Of Animal Behavior (AVSAB), that recognize some credentials as more legitimate than others, but again this isn't legally regulated.There is nothing stopping me from starting a website called [animalbehaviortraining.com](https://animalbehaviortraining.com), uploading some lectures and quizzes, providing a certificate for feline behavior mastery (CFBM) and stopping you from putting CFBM after your name. Honestly, Animal Behavior Institute looks exactly like an example of this.I'm sure there are plenty of self-proclaimed behaviorists in the world, with the alphabet soup of credentials after their names, making plenty of money consulting pet owners about their pet's behaviors. How legitimate these services are or valid the advice they are giving? Who knows.|Hey - I'm a current resident at a large academic institution and went to Penn for my internship. It totally depends on the program. Some programs interview and not receiving an invite seems to be a pretty good tell that they aren't interested - like Florida, Colorado, Wisconsin. I've heard of a few programs that will interview some people but will be radio silent for others that still get in - the main one being NC state. Other programs are radio silent for everyone.|I'd imagine so, unless they swapped to no or few interviews this year. I wouldn't have that influence your rank list though. If, for example, Florida is your ideal internship, I would still rank it as 1. It may also be possible that they only interview their top 20 but still have 50 people ranked.",,,,,

The hardest part for me was just sitting through that many questions.|I don’t even look twice at jobs that don’t post salary. Or at least salary ranges.|I’ve been involved in gorilla procedures, general wellness exams. We had a human cardiologist, gynecologist, and dental specialists all come for the procedures. We also had an extensive team of veterinarians and vet techs involved in all aspects. Zoo vets are AMAZING generalists. They know a good amount about a great deal of species. It’s so incredibly impressive but they’re typically not specialized the same way human doctors are. For procedures that require this amount of specialization, we call in human doctors who have spent years and years studying this one aspect of medicine because humans and gorillas are similar. We also want them under anesthesia for the least amount of time, so having someone who does this constantly helps things go more quickly and smoothly.|This is not okay. My first job out was overnight ER. I didn’t have any idea what I was doing, but I needed a job and they needed a willing doctor, so there I was. I loved it. And the reason I loved it was because my techs were so supportive. They knew I was brand new, so they encouraged me. If it was something I’d never done, they talked through how other doctors typically did it, they helped me research things, they gave me their thoughts with no judgement.  You definitely need to talk to management about how these techs are treating you. It’s not right and it’s not helpful in fostering an environment for you to continue to grow. Even now, my techs will just ask for confirmation or gracefully discuss their concerns if they have them. And we can have a discussion on why or why not  their thinking is correct.|Make sure to take your breaks. Get up and walk around, drink water, have a snack. The hardest part for me was just sitting through that many questions.|I don’t even look twice at jobs that don’t post salary. Or at least salary ranges.|I’m a vet, the hardest part for me is what you described as well. The actual patient, whether euthanasia or code, can be distressing or difficult but the hardest things for me tucking it all away and moving to the next patient. It’s okay to take time, it’s okay to tell your vet you need a minute, it’s okay to cry. I’ve sat in a room after a euthanasia and just cried for a few minutes. There is so much compartmentalization in our field, but it’s okay to take a little time to process before shoving it away to do the next thing. ALSO it is always recommended to have a debriefing session after a code so everyone can talk about what went well, what could be improved, and really gives you time to think over what happened.|First time as well!

It seems crazy to me they would leave a student alone on their first day at this clinic to do this procedure.|I teach students, I ask them if they’re comfortable or have experience doing things. Even when they say yes, I stay close by or monitor the entire process. This isn’t your fault, though it does seem like you need to change some of your techniques and stop shooting for a specific time with your surgeries.|Had to pass the course with a 70 or greater. If you failed the final but we’re passing the course before that, you could take a make up exam. If you failed that you needed to appeal to stay. The policy was you couldn’t fail more than 2 course total and past 1st semester you couldn’t fail more than 2 in one semester. People failed more, it just depended on the appear and everything.|I do them occasionally. It’s impossible to do a thorough PE, give vaccines, and take blood in 6 minutes, worse if you’re double booked in that time. I listen to heart/lungs, check eyes, ears, teeth, and feel belly and testicles if they’re intact and recommend neutering. That’s generally the extent of my exam, and I write unable to examine in areas that I don’t get to. The clients get this information so they see if we didn’t examine something. The staff rotates and makes a big difference. I have worked with a decent amount of new or untrained staff and having someone who can’t restrain well hampers it too. I have had staff tell me that they have doctors who literally count breaths and take aural temps and put unable to examine for the rest of the PE. That’s not right to me, so I do a cursory exam with the time allotted. I have brought my feedback up to Vetco about double booking 6 minute appointments already and taking walk ins. It’s ridiculous in my opinion and they paid me more at the last clinic I did because I stayed almost an hour and a half over. I’m not sure if I’ll be doing more in the future because they feel poorly run most of the time.|I’m not but I generally recommend owners follow up with a primary care vet for any issue I see. And that this doesn’t replace their annual exam.|>Is it worth it financially and mentally? I’m in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. The school I went to was expensive but I knew that going in. “Worth it” is hard to say. I think it was worth it for me, as I don’t let my loans control my life, but my payments right now are very low. That might change in the future. Mentally sure, again I knew what I was getting in to. >How hard would you rank the education level? Vet school was the hardest thing I’ve done both mentally and academically. And it doesn’t stop with vet school. I am learning constantly every day. This profession is about being a life long learner. If you don’t love that, it’s not for you. >What characteristics would make you suitable or not for this position? Decent people skills. This is a customer service job at its core, with medicine thrown in. Obviously this depends on the area of medicine you’re in but I spend most of my time talking to clients, techs, or students. Patience is a good skill to have, along with resiliency. Some days will beat you down. >Lastly, what other animal jobs are there that are similar to this?Depends what you mean. Practicing medicine with animals? None. Caring for and working with animals? Vet tech, zoo keeper, boarding facility worker, wildlife facility worker, etc. The big thing here is you need to spend some time around our profession to see if it’s for you.

It's like they want to break your spirits, they find joy breaking your spirit. I had one clinican make me feel like I was so incompetent, when in reality it was cause I was taking all the ECC onco cases cause my rotation mates were 4th years and would not take cases just simple appointments. It took me one rotation away from the university to remember my passion and restore my spirit. When I cam back to clinics I was so annoyed. I did not want to be there. Everyone just seemed so bitter. Vet med academia is toxic. One of the reasons I didn't even think about residency, who wants to be in that misery for 4 years with shitty pay.|Honestly reading through all these experiences just brought me back to clinical year and made me sad. We NEED to do something to change the culture, this is sad and a reason we're so short staffed. What can we do?

I ask that because I do wonder if they’re looking to take care of it first, clients then balk at the pricing that is much more than they were expecting based on previous experience, and then they’re being told well if they don’t pay the euth isn’t happening. I’ve worked at practices where prior to scheduling a euth, pricing for services were discussed so people could be prepared coming in and know what they’d like to do. That doesn’t help in a situation where an owner comes in not expecting to have the appointment end in euthanasia though. In my own personal experience, there are some serious issues these days with how some practices are being run (corporate vet med is horrifying). Last April I had to say goodbye to my 16 year old little lady. When we’ve previously had to call to set up a euth at that practice, they had been a practice that went over pricing for services on the phone with us so we were prepared. This time, everything was so abrupt it didn’t even register they didn’t. This practice was corporate bought out and has undergone serious changes over the last 5 years. We just had her euthanized. We brought her body home and buried her on our property (legal where I am). She was 12 lbs. It was over $300 for the euthanasia. Strictly euthanasia. Just a catheter and the drugs. No appointment cost because we’d just come in the day before looking to say goodbye, the vet convinced us to try one more med to give us a bit more time, and then the next morning it was clear the medication was going to do nothing to buy her more time. I’m all for paying staff and keeping the practice doors open, but after we said goodbye and got in the car, I turned and asked my wife “we had the money to do this and say goodbye humanely. What are people who don’t have the money doing? Over $300 for a 12 lbs dog is not insignificant and plenty of people wouldn’t be able to afford that.” Approximately 5 years prior a euthanasia at that practice for an 80 lbs lab was $150 with cremation being an additional cost. If clients at OP’s practice are experiencing a similar level of sticker shock, I get them being exceptionally upset. But if CSRs are following up with we won’t perform euthanasia until you pay, that is a problem. There are absolutely more compassionate ways to handle that and a policy like that would drive me from the practice as an employee. Even working emergency in a role where I was building estimates and presenting them to clients, we’d never approach it like that when there were serious financial concerns with a life threatening condition. I can’t wrap my mind around telling people you need to pay now or we’re not euthanizing as essentially an opening line. That is just wild and such a bad management policy.",,,,,

So we're happy with how things are at the moment.|I'm not sure if this comment will be seen, but as a recent grad myself (1+ years now), I've found myself quite anxious for the first couple of months (the fear of potentially misdiagnosing/ mucking up surgery) - and it will happen. Not just due to poor knowledge/ execution of a consult but because owners are limited on how much they can cover for diagnostics.However, there are a couple of things that I have learned that come in handy with every consult.1. Do not be shy to send for referral/ samples to labs - They will often send you clinical notes about the referral case so that you can learn for next time when presented with a similar case.2. Familiarise yourself with the drugs you have at the clinic - (you don't have to memorise every drug in your university notes!)3. Join a clinic that is willing to help - there will be a few hiccups but staff/ clients are often understanding of new grads and the anxiety we feel4. Go over previous consults on your system that other vets have done at the clinic - this is crucial to get a handle on how things run at the clinic.5. Go over notes on common cases such as vaccines, skin consults and gastro cases and there will always be a vet you can ask for help.6. Get Balckwells 5 minute consults/ VIN - Both are awesome sources7. Enjoy it! Think of all the effort you've put in to get here.

2631,TekelTroubadour,2,"First off, I am sorry that you’re dealing with this sort of treatment at work. I’m sure it is very frustrating and will eventually lead to resentment and more negativity about your work environment. I can share my experience as someone who worked in the veterinary industry for over a decade. I worked at a couple of small animal practices, then large animal, and, eventually, emergency medicine during college to even out my resume for a potential vet school application. All of these clinics taught me different things, but the emergency clinic probably expanded my knowledge and experience the most due to the nature of the things being treated and fast paced environment. Ironically, the ER was also the final piece of the puzzle that led me to realize attending vet school would not be in my best interest long term. I should note that during my time in undergrad, I saw many of my piers (from shared classes and major) get accepted to vet school, attend, and eventually graduate and practice. So, I am aware of their experiences as new grads, and a lot of their initial success as vets depended on where they were hired. There is a vast scale of the perceived respect given to new grads that varies from a vet going back to work at a clinic they may have previously been employed at where they are known/their work ethic is understood, versus, say, someone going into large animal medicine without any experience working with farm animals until vet school. There is a certain period of time that will vary among both individual practices and specialty in which the new grad is expected to show a certain amount of reverence towards the other doctors (and even experienced techs) because they are still considered to be in a learning phase of how to transition from student to practicing doctor. This is not to say that you shouldn’t be respected in your own right for your accomplishments as well as knowledge and experience. As many others have pointed out, the tech refusing to use your doctor prefix is in the wrong, and you should address this with them directly or through management channels. Unfortunately, there can be stigmas in the industry related to age and gender. Despite being a female dominated field, there can be misogyny even among women with the misconception that a female doctor has to work harder to gain the same respect that a male counterpart (equal in every way) gets by default. This disparity can also be seen in a young new grad that is working with techs that may be older or have more time spent in the industry. This could be something at play with the tech that won’t refer to you as “Doctor —“. This doesn’t excuse their behavior, but it can be difficult for some people to use titles of authority with people that are younger than them.|Continued…When I graduated college, I took a job at a clinic that I had previously worked for while I was interviewing for other positions/career paths. I experienced two new graduate veterinary hires during that time that were very different, and their experiences as new grad hires differed too. One hire was very close to my age at the time (maybe mid-late twenties to early thirties), but she did not have very much practical experience. She even shared that she had taken an additional externship after graduation to get more hands on experience practicing medicine before feeling comfortable applying for a traditional job. There were clients that didn’t want to see her because of her age, and there were clients that didn’t care and ended up exclusively requesting her because they liked her personality and how she explained things. Originally, she only worked when another vet would be there too, but eventually the schedule didn’t always allow this, so she was scheduled with at least two experienced techs. Sometimes I was one of those techs, and, when working with her, it was clear that she second guessed herself a lot and only felt comfortable talking to clients after consulting her books or other resources. There were a few emergency type cases that came through during this time which I felt confident in diagnosing from seeing the same things in ER practice, and so I suggested she start with a certain diagnostic test or initial stabilization techniques. In this case, she did not like suggestions coming from someone who did not have a DVM, and we ended up losing a patient due to time lost from her consulting resources. This caused me and a few other techs to lose respect for this doctor because it was clear she did not value us. We all stayed respectful and continued to offer help and suggestions to her, but ultimately she left the position because she felt the work environment was hostile, though none of us ever tried to do anything but assist. The other new graduate was older and had gone back to school after an initial career and raising her family. She had some of the same issues of needing to double check her work, but the clients all assumed she had been in the field for some time due to her age. She accepted a lot more help from technicians and other doctors, and seemed to have a stronger start to her career.No one should be questioning whether you are “worthy” of your doctor title, but to say that there won’t be some sort of questioning of your abilities for a while would be misleading. You aren’t incompetent, and admitting you still have things to learn shows that your ego isn’t too big, so it sounds like your best bet would be addressing things you dislike as they occur—either in the moment or later in the day/week if the time/place isn’t appropriate. You could demonstrate how you were taught to do something, while asking the techs if they have a better technique or suggestion for you, regardless if you’ll use it or not. Sometimes, “killing them with kindness” can be a useful approach since it seems like you’re only having an issue with half of the techs. Things do tend to improve with time, but acknowledging you’re in a “proving ground” time period will help with rationalizing things. Many people go into vet med because they love animals and that doesn’t always translate to being very good with people. You should definitely bring your concerns to management if things continue excessively or get worse. Reemphasize that you are learning, but the constant nit-picking/questioning of you has become detrimental to performing your job smoothly is one way of phrasing things.Thanks to any that read all the way through! All of my piers that attended vet school and experienced similar new grad inferiority complexes are doing well and practicing successfully now. Most would admit there was a “hazing” like period where they had to prove worth to certain technicians, doctors, or staff, but this usually didn’t extend to the owner/vet that hired them. Toxic practice managers that don’t take concerns or complaints seriously, offer practical solutions, or that won’t go to bat for their workers will always be red flags. Bad managers are almost always a sign that a particular clinic/hospital won’t be a good fit, and having a good fit while you’re learning the ropes is super important! Yes, being able to pay your bills is important too, but don’t feel bad for trying to find a new job if it becomes clear the clinic you’re at will not be a good fit for long. Remember that all clinics can have bad actors, and the industry can be incredible cliquish, but you are worthy of respect and the doctor title that you earned! Best of luck in your endeavors and new career!|I find the seasoned techs are much more eager to help teach what they have learned, especially when asked questions, than having their experience taken for granted—which can happen when working with vets of any and all experience levels! They are also more likely to recognize where you may not have certain experience versus just thinking you know nothing.

Zoo veterinarians don’t get payed well at all, and from what I’ve heard, the work-life balance isn’t great either. Also, the residency programs are among the most competitive programs for any speciality in veterinary medicine (I think the acceptance rate is like 3% or around there most years). If you want to work at backyard zoos, you just need a DVM, and not the other stuff (ie board certification). Not trying to be discouraging, but zoologic medicine is definitely one of the hardest if not the hardest field to break into and to stay in within veterinary medicine.|I’m a 3rd year veterinary student who is considering small animal specialty practice. There are just so many problems with internship/residency right now. Obviously the pay at most of these programs is just terrible. Not sure how someone is expected to live on $35-$38k/year in a mid-sized city or urban area. You literally won’t get approved for an apartment. I also really think there needs to be more help for couples who are looking to apply to the match during the same cycle. They have this in human medicine.

I definitely agree with you that this is a problem. New vet schools popping up everywhere that don’t actually have the resources to properly educate students. I can only hope that the AVMA continues to be highly selective with which programs receive accreditation.|There are so many problems with the veterinary professional associate proposal. Who in their right mind is gonna go and get a masters degree to be a glorified vet tech? Also, the idea that a DVM would be legally responsible for the VPA’s performance is terrifying. Being a veterinarian is already one of the most stressful jobs you could have as evidenced by the high suicide rate. Making vets legally responsible for the mistakes of unqualified pseudo-doctors would increase veterinarians’ stress levels significantly. The answer to the vet shortage question is to improve and expand the pool of DVM programs, not create these weird new positions.|There is already a critical shortage of veterinarians in the United States. This shortage is projected to continue to get worse and worse. If you pay vets less, that’s not exactly going to help the situation.|Focus on getting into vet school first. Once you’re in vet school, you can start to think about specialties. I thought I knew what I wanted to do going into vet school, but it turned out not to be the case.|A couple of things here. First, a lot of places use the pro-sal model for compensating associates, including new grads. This means that salary is only one part of your income. If you look at the most recent AVMA annual survey (https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady), the average starting compensation for new grads in small animal is $133k. So, what you really need to be looking at is what is the compensation structure that is being offered. Is it $100k straight salary, or is it $100k with 21% production on top of that? Big difference between the two. Also, job ads are just that, job ads. A clinic can offer whatever they want on indeed…doesn’t mean anyone is going to sign for that. I’m always surprised by the number of posts we get on this subreddit from practice managers and recruiters who don’t understand what compensation is considered industry-standard nowadays. Bottom line is, veterinarians are in extremely high demand right now as there is a nation-wide shortage. If I was a new grad going into small animal (unless planing to work in a very rural or low-cost of living area) I would not even entertain any offers with starting salary of less than $120k. New grads often don’t make very much in production on top of that because they aren’t super efficient. Once you start producing enough billings to earn production incentives, you should be looking anywhere in the $150k-200k range for an experienced associate unless in a very rural or poor area.|According to data from the AVMA, in small animal practice, the average compensation for a new graduate is $133k/year now. So 100k for a new grad is kind of the absolute minimum.|Becoming a licensed vet tech does not take 4 years of full-time schooling.|The point of my comment was not to suggest that I think LVT pay is adequate, it is not.|I could be wrong since I am a small animal person (vet student), but this is what I know. You really don’t need to specialize to work with food animals generally speaking. There are far fewer food animal vets than there are small animal vets in the United States, so there are going to be more opportunities of all kinds for small animal-related things. Making traditional internships and residencies required to work in a field with a huge shortage of vets already would be a terrible idea for obvious reasons. Additionally, I don’t think that most producers would necessarily pay more for the services of a “specialist” than a regular veterinarian, so spending several years after graduation in training financially wouldn’t make sense for new vets.If you look on the VIRMP (https://www.virmp.org) it does appear that there are internships and residency opportunities available in food animal medicine. My guess is that these are really designed for people who want to go into academia/research more so than for folks to want to go into practice, but they do exist.There are specialist certifications you can get through ABVP in beef, dairy, and food animal. However, since these are through ABVP, it’s done through a clinical route rather than a traditional residency program.Here is a link to the AVMA recognized specialties. https://www.avma.org/education/veterinary-specialtiesThere are lots of ways you can learn about food animal medicine beyond just what you are doing in vet school. I don’t know what program you are at, but most programs have various food animal clubs that participate in activities such as palpations and pregnancy checks, lambing, calving, farm call ride- alongs, etc. They also have guest speakers who are knowledgeable in the field. I would look into opportunities like these to learn more during your didactic years of vet school.|I’ve taken about the same number (a few more) but they were spread out more than yours were thankfully.|It really depends on the program you are in and how efficient you are with your studying.

2676,Which-Dragonfly1265,2,"I'm glad to see colleagues who have an interest in this and think it is an important issue. Obviously it is complex issue and individuals/groups that have a financial stake in it often don't have the best interests of our professions at heart. Here are some other thoughts I have on the matter that I didn't elaborate on above.1. We are a small profession. That means our educational institutions don't have the luxury to just produce veterinarians. That is, of course, the primary goal but quality institutions also support significant research activities to advance the state of medicine, train interns/residents/graduate students, perform outreach activities, etc. None of these new schools do this to a significant degree which hurts our profession. If a vet school popped up at Columbia or Harvard, I suppose it would be a different issue.2. At some point, the expansion will lead us down the route of the legal profession. Tons of schools with only the graduates of ""top tier"" schools able to find employment out of schools as well as internships or residencies. Human medicine is somewhat insulated from this as the number of practicing physicians is limited by the number of residency positions NOT the number of graduating physicians/medical schools. I DO realize that a pedigree can help get a human residency but it is a different playing field. I don't know how dentistry is fairing due to this phenomenon. Are there too many dental schools?3. The profession can largely blame the AVMA and COE for this situation. The first distributive was initially denied accreditation and in response, sued the AVMA. Mark Cushing was a part of that. The AVMA caved. Let me be clear, there are positives to the distributive model and if the institution also prioritizes research, training, etc, then they can be an asset. University of Calgary is a great example of this. University of Arizona could be one as well but they have their own problems (namely poor NAVLE scores).4. Debt - Private schools that have distributive models don't try to reduce costs by not having a teaching hospital. They just charge the student market rates. This is criminal. Teaching hospitals are a MAJOR expense to a school. Do these new schools paying the offsite rotation hospitals an equivalent amount to running a teaching hospital annually? I doubt it. This is just compounding the problem of debt for our students.5. Like many have commented, the goal of training DVMs to fill rural positions is ludicrous. This is a ploy parroted by the new programs to use as justification. Unless rural position provide incentive with higher salaries or loan repayment, solving rural shortage by producing more DVMs is not going to work.What can we do about it? I don't know. There is a lot of money involved and key players in academic leadership (deans) and the AVMA stand to benefit from moving into the private sector and helping groups like the animal policy group. So they don't rock the boat. There is no money to be made for apposing it and no ones got time to do it. It has to be out of passion and love for our profession. But here are some thoughts.1. Discussions amongst interest groups. Things like discussions on VIN, local and state VMAs, speciality colleges, conferences, etc. But there is also something to be said about having this issue blow up on social media, which is why the younger generation of DVMs is so important. I'm old and not social media savvy. Getting a post to reddit was difficult for me. But I've seen the power of ""not one more vet"" (NOMV). Maybe something like that could help.2. Getting involved and being vocal. This can be with state VMAs, the AVMA, etc. Getting involved in the COE. Writing letters to editor for JAVMA.Any other ideas?",,,,,

Additionally I know a lot of universities in Italy offer the possibility of pursuing a degree as a part-time student; it takes longer than the usual time-span, but it gives you time to still have a job and sustain yourself financially.Sorry for the wall of text, I hope it is useful, I don't know where you're from in Europe, but Italy might be a decent choice if you're looking for relatively cheap places to study.",,,,,

You’re wasting your time trying to become a better vet through the navle. I switched to Zuku and I found that to be a bit better. VetPrep does a better job of explaining things but I found VetPrep tends to hyperfixate on some topics (why are there 500 questions on listeriosis?). The Zuku question bank is more diverse, IMO. Get accommodation if you can. Anxiety, ADD, ect all have a chance of being eligible for time accommodation and there’s no penalty for being turned down.|The thing that surprised me the most about failing the navle for the first time is that absolutely nobody cares. It feels a bit embarrassing and your student cohort may gossip or whatever, but on a professional level nobody cares whatsoever. Everyone who has passed it has taken it, and most people who have taken it agree it’s pretty much valueless. In fact, if any vet professional or veterinary organisation thinks less of you for having resat the exam, that’s a huge red flag avoided.|I wonder if there is a 6 hour computer science exam the ICVA can take?|If I fail this exam again, I’m just gonna apply to work at the ICVA.

2689,usernameTH1S,0,"I agree with the principle of this letter, but devils advocate, some of this is just not really true. At least not everywhere. I went through internship and finished residency last year, and have also been part of the intern selection committee several times including this past year.- my residency was private practice with expectation to work for them after, and I did not get a low ball offer. I interviewed and looked at some other non corp positions just to see, and they made the same or worse offers. I felt like my hospital really wanted me to stay and was actually very competitive even with the expectation I would stay. - salaries: definitely suck but outside of academia, seem to be getting better every year. VCAs are paying interns $80k I believe which is definitely livable. I’m biased bc in California intern salaries are regulated by min wage laws but definitely not true everywhere so for sure could be better. - Quality of life: also can definitely suck, but my impression is there is a consistent trend towards more sustainable intern life. My hospital (and I think all programs in the area) have 2 guaranteed days off, and actually get 3 in a row off when they are on ER (they work 4 days/week). Don’t get me wrong there is certainly room for improvement but it is definitely better even than when I was an intern. - selection process: I can only speak to the intern selection but it is 100% merit based. I put in probably 30 hours each VIRMP season reviewing/interviewing applicants and then a huge meeting to decide on rank order. It is very unbiased I would say, we just want good people that will succeed in our hospital and will hopefully get out of it what they were looking for. I know my experience is not everyone else’s and there should be improvements.

Ultimately no easy answer you really have to go hospital by hospital.|Two things1) You’re being too hard on yourself, and EVERYONE has the sense of “imposter syndrome” at some point (usually many points) of their training/career. I’m a ER/critical care specialist and very confident in my skills/knowledge, but even so once in a while I still find myself thinking “these people seem smarter than me”. Just push through it because it’s all in our heads 🙂2) Being “smart” is over rated as far as vet and med school goes. Yes your life is easier if you have a good memory or naturally good critical thinking skills, but that is 10% of undergrad/vet school. 90% of it is discipline and study skills, which it sounds like you have.

There are standard positions for many of our domestics, and those adapt somewhat well to many of our mammalian exotics, but not always. I think Maders has guidelines for standard imaging on different types of herps, and Quesenbury has them for small mammal.Often for small mammals, small reptiles, and birds, we do whole body rads. Typically not enough space on the animal to collimate out what you're not interested in anyway.

My first practice unfortunately started me on 20 minute appointments, if I could do it all over again I'd definitely want at least 40. Getting those reps in will help you build confidence in each topic and plan out a speel.. and it's always fine to say ""hey I don't know, I'll find out"" and go read some journals and find your answer.. like for the weird dog respiratory disease, I had a bunch of clients that I sent an email to once I had a chance to read up from trusted sources. I read a lot of journals anyway, largely because I'm trying to get out of GP and into a pathology residency or a research lab and so for every residency I applied to, I read up their universities recent major publications, and likewise for each lab I applied to, I read their entire bibliography.I tend to be more of a ""lumper"" which helps since your initial diagnostic approach for each differential under each case ""archetype"" is going to be pretty similar.. and most of those are common enough that you'll have plenty of repetition. I also use Blackwell's 5 minute consult and I use Veterinary Partner for handouts on specific diseases. You can do CE for areas you feel weak. Conferences tend to also focus on common diseases more often. For the exotics stuff, a mix of externships, firsthand experience, and CE. Lefeber is a good place to start, Miami also hosts a monthly free CE for mostly exotics hematology and clinical pathology topics, and then respective professional societies (WAVMA and ARAV) and their journals and CE. I did a couple lab animal conferences (POLA and CLASS) that helped with rodents, rabbits, and fish. I took a master herpetologist course that helped a lot with husbandry for the reptiles and amphibians.|For pathology, depends highly on what you end up doing. Salaries for academia aren't great. Salaries for industry/reference labs tend to be fairly good.

At my first job out of school, I got one and a half days off per week and 2 weeks total vacation per year and had to work out coverage for any vacations (or conferences) with my coworkers, and I would get last pick of vacation dates and conferences because I was the most junior. It may also cut into your travel.. like I had that office call me at my friends wedding to ask about an exotics case because none of the other vets felt comfortable answering, which was rather frustrating.. A classmate of mine is at a larger clinic (corporate, like 10ish doctors) so she has a lot more freedom with time off and travel. Meanwhile some specialties have travel cooked into your job - like USDA or other public health/regulatory positions. And, of course, if you're a leader in your specialty you'll get invited to speak at conferences, and between the conference and your employer, someone will often cover some part of your travel expenses (like hotel room or the conference admission). May not be locations you always want to visit - although I'm finally getting to see the national zoo as part of an upcoming conference - but it's still travel even if a good chunk of it will be spent learning/working.You also have to consider travel expenses with your student debt.|The internship requirement is becoming absurd. Even in pathology - which doesn't require an internship - a lot of programs are giving preference to students who have completed an internship, and there's a growing number of pathology specific internships where your duties look suspiciously similar to a resident, but you don't qualify for boards and the pay is somehow even lower.. and they're one year appointments so you have that additional financial barrier of needing to move for just one year of work. They state it's because you'll have additional clinical insight from your internship, but working as a clinician rather than an intern apparently doesn't count for that because you couldn't understand the academic rigor. Working as a clinician full-time while getting a masters apparently doesn't count either. And I've noticed - for at least two programs that I'm aware of - the residency director has openly slept with students or residents and still holds that position. Although I think the most egregious example I know of was when (and details are left vague to protect identities) a resident discovered that their significant other at another institution had attempted suicide and was punished for taking PTO to go visit their SO in the hospital.|Jobs/pay: yeahhh vet pay is almost always lower.

Prepare for the usual sorts of interview questions (there's some really good examples online) and don't panic. They're just trying to find out if you're a good fit for them, and you should also see if they're a good fit for you. Nobody is out to trick you or intentionally ask anything confusing or difficult.Be yourself, rest up the night before, dress nice and find a space with minimal distractions.

If youre also into amphibians consider ARAV as well.|I mean yeah I'd agree the main focus is dog medicine - even cats are often taught as a variant to dogs, although we had a whole semester of equine/ruminant anatomy - but from what I've seen a lot of vet schools are pretty ""customizable"" although usually that means you have to set that opportunity up yourself. We had tracks for large animals, small animal, mixed, and equine and then you could also ""build your own""I was lucky enough to go to a school that had a pretty solid aquatics foundation, we had a class taught by a CertAqV and an active WAVMA chapter that did a lot of wetlabs so I got a good chunk of my credit for the CertAqV done while in school. My school didn't do any live exotics on clinics so I had to do all external rotations and set them up myself. I had classmates doing aquatics who did summer internships with zoos or aquariums or with aquaculture producers. I'm more into toxicologic pathology so I did lab animal stuff with our zebrafish colonies.|Ohio State - certainly still not perfect but they did at least have electives in exotics (which have gotten better since it's now Dr. Nick Jew from Medvet teaching the reptile/amphibian classes and Dr. Oglesbee teaching rabbits and avian medicine) and aquatics (last I heard, it was Dr. Flint and Dr. Malbrue teaching, we also had Dr. Coble and I think he's still in the area so he might still guest lecture)They went through a curriculum redesign but last I heard, they still had a good selection of electives and then our clinical year was very customizable. Still not perfect - they have many of the systemic issues with vet school like treating the students as free labor to supplement their hiring shortages, and they don't see exotics in their hospital except for the necropsy floor and through lab animal - but I thought they did a fair job.|Apoquel did not have a [significantly different incidence of cancers](https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/257/5/javma.257.5.507.xml) compared to other allergy therapies (corticosteroids and cyclosporine) which makes sense because it's fairly selective for JAK1. The caution for use in pets with a history of certain cancers also isn't really based on anything from the tox data for apoquel specifically, it comes from data on less selective JAK inhibitors (such as Jakafi and Xeljanz) used on the human side. Theoretically blocking JAK1 (and therefore IL2 and IL4) carries some risk of inhibiting NK Cell activation which should still be considered in patients with a history of certain types of cancer.|Join ARAV if you haven't already! There's a student Facebook page; we have some fun plans to get it more interactive this year|Tbh it's kind of a matter of picking your battles. Ideally we'd do it perfect every time, but that's not really practical (especially on a senior pug!) so in that case it depends on the test you're running and what you're after. Like most if not all tests run off a blue top NEED to be perfectly full and NEED to be a clean stick because they tend to be for coags. I don't really care so much if it's going into a serum separator, since it'll clot anyway, as long as we're not hemolyzing the sample a ton. Purple is kind of an in-between with a frustrating amount of ""it depends"" - if it's just for a 4DX I wouldn't be too concerned, if it's for wellness I care a bit more but not the end of the world, if I'm suspicious or monitoring like a low platelet number, I'd absolutely want it to be a clean stick and a full tube on just that stick.. and if you have to poke twice and can get enough for a full purple the second poke, I'd rather have that purple all be from the same stick, but I'd also rather have one full purple with the right anticoagulant to blood ratio vs two partially-full purples with the wrong ratio if that's what it comes to. Also adding through a vaccutainer can be problematic because that vacuum is calibrated to the ideal draw volume for the tube and if you lose the vacuum, you're then guesstimating the right ratio, although depending on what/why you're testing that can be more or less problematic. Pushing into the vaccutainer through the needle can also lead to hemolysis, so if I have to add to a purple, I usually take the cap off and remove my needle.|I'd second trying to shadow a local practice, but you'd likely have to be over 18 for them to allow it.In the meantime try and get some general horse experience if you haven't already. If you're already involved in the equestrian world a bit, it'll be easier to get into equine medicine.

I do modified three clamp for larger dogs with one circumferential in the crush and one transfixing. I typically use hemoclips for rabbits. Small rodents are often just cautery. I do scrotal neuters for cats, prescrotal for dogs, varies for other species. I tend to close any incision with intradermals, since it keeps the animal from messing with the incision as much. I do a local block for the same reason.

Clear and straightforward. I also like to see certain amenities (I like having an ultrasound and endoscopy and in-house labs. I mainly use endoscopy for exotics, though). I want to be able to practice the way I feel comfortable and have the tools to be successful. I do NOT want to see non-competes or other restrictive components to the contract. I don't really care about production if the base salary is good, but I don't want to see negative accrual.

I was a vet assistant in high school, it was a really steep learning curve but after a couple months I got used to handling and everything. Tbh, for the syringe thing, just ask if you can take home a syringe without a needle and practice pulling it back and handling safely. Don't be afraid to ask - safety first!I ended up leaving vet med for a while to pursue archaeology and then ended up in medical research and then eventually a small zoo.. and didn't come back to small animal until I got a job as a vet assistant in vet school. It was a steep learning curve all over again, I was like ""what the heck is a cytopoint"" (when I'd left small animal practice, apoquel had just come on the market) and cat handling and care had come along SO far (and tbh the field is all the better for it!)|Depends on your state practice act. I would also make sure to get full informed consent from the owner. I was allowed to assist with TNR during my first year of vet school under supervision from a vet, and my school did a summer externship program for first years where they could do small animal practice after their first year under supervision, including surgery duties.And I would get the SAVMA student liability insurance if you're doing it.|I really enjoyed comparative physiology and pathology. It's really cool to see the different ""answers"" that life came up with for different problems.

2697,RedPenguinGB,2,"Looking at Vetspire, it seems radically.. coherent(?) compared to other PMSes I've seen. It's kind of funny, I'm surprised by good software now haha.I've done a bunch of pricing research and the figures I've seen are crazy. $100-300 per user is super high, especially compared to other Vertical SaaS solutions in other markets. Do you think $25-50 per user would be a reasonable ask for something that does what Vetspire, Vetstoria, PetDesk, and VetPay does? I suppose you can call it a practice-in-a-box. That and switching support of course.I've seen documentation for some PMSes that covered their APIs. That might let me move records programmatically. Is data loss a massive fear here or is it moreso just an inconvenience that can really screw with one's daily workflow?|I've taken a look at ezyVet in my initial research. Having used stuff like Vercel to host stuff at work, all the tabs and odd UX choices were confusing to say the least. Why do you think it's intuitive? I feel like there's something I'm missing. I look at it and get confused but maybe it's because I'm not used to it? I don't know. Do you feel like the amount of training you needed to do for staff was substantial? Do you think that software more in line with modern UX trends (stuff that looks like Reddit and works like you expect, ex.: bottom tabs on mobile with familiar icons etc) would have reduced that?I assumed that ezyVet being a cloud system, there wouldn't be much troubleshooting to do. Like with serverless databases you don't really worry about updating the host's software. What types of troubleshooting do you find yourself doing often? Why is HTML knowledge required for it? Does ezyVet just use it for invoice and SOAP templates? Surprising that you'd need a support call to resolve these, I'd expect it all to be user-accessible.Speaking about your experience with that EHR system, would you say that space for customisability with reasonable defaults is the best way to build software like this? (what you can do with Notion using templates and fully custom Notion pages)Speaking about your new clinic, congrats! Starting a new clinic is a whole thing and I can't imagine the complexity involved. Is there something that would make you consider trying out new software having all this experience? Or is it that just ezyVet makes things happen and it's good enough for that?Do you think that requiring a tech-savvy admin is a barrier for people getting a lot out of ezyVet and other PMSes? Do many clinics have tech-savvy admins even?Thank you for your comment, it really helped me understand a bit more about all this. Please feel free to answer as many questions of mine as you like, I know there's a lot of them. I'm just super interested in seeing if there's software I can develop that can outdo these solutions. It's still just an inkling of an idea, but it does seem feasible. Do you think it's a good idea to try making it happen? Thanks again|Just had a very quick look through Neo's website and it definitely looks better than the scary Avimark/Cornerstone screenshots I've seen. I can see how it makes more sense than these. Is customisation a big thing for you in a PMS? How much customisation and what type (apart from invoices&soap templates) is the most important to you? I can see how cloud based stuff must've felt to use for the first time. In my profession, we've had cloud stuff for a while but, when I moved from a company that self-hosted a bunch of stuff, it was a breath of fresh air.I can definitely relate to the cost-wise part of it all.

Just being a software engineer doesn't make someone technical, and I've had situations where colleagues were confused after we switched out a CI system or something else.

What are some of the issues you've had post switching?Thanks for reading my post and sending a comment. I really appreciate your time.|Do you think a cost in the neighbourhood of $25-$50 per user per month would be prohibitive for most practices?

It really helps me understand what you guys need and are looking for.|Thanks for taking the time to read through my comments and to reply!I'm surprised to find out Vetspire doesn't actually work well. But I guess I did judge a book based on its cover. The whole voting situation is a horrendous disaster and I'm kind of shocked that this is even a thing that happens. Imagine if Microsoft did stuff like this with Windows. Absolutely bananas.Yeah, you're completely right here. I'm definitely feeling like I have a lot to learn and have applied for jobs at local clinics but have more of a software engineering background rather than an IT one which is what most of them would be looking for. Still trying though. I'm considering just approaching vet clinics and seeing which ones would be willing to let me have a day in their life. I don't think many will go for it, but it's worth a try. I really want to understand what's needed to make this happen.You're also completely right on the practice type front. I have this massive idea that spans the whole pet care industry but to start out I'd like to focus on General Practice clinics as these are the ones I know people in + have the most knowledge about. Later on, I'd like to focus on other practice types. I don't want to make a one-size-fits-all solution because here one size really doesn't fit all.I don't want to follow in Vetspire's footsteps. Tbh, I'd rather build separate pieces of software for particular clinic types because even in one clinic type there's multiple scopes you need to cover (does it work well for the vets? does it work well for the finance people? does it work well for the managers? etc). I still need to draw up the requirements and solidify my plan, but that helps a lot. Is there something specific Vetspire failed to do for you? I'm trying to understand where that generalised approach made things difficult for you. Thanks again for your time. This helps a lot with understanding what you guys need.|Thank you so much for the in-depth reply! It's super exciting and interesting to find out more about what you work with daily. Definitely won't be boring to me. You've had quite the career! Congrats on the professional success and I'm happy you've found a place to settle down. I'm still looking for mine and trying out a variety of cities/countries and hope to find a nice place where me, my fiancée, and my cat can buy a home and relax.It's really cool to see how that workflow can pan out in a high speed place like a vet hospital. Short versions of data seem important. The colour coding etc seems to drive that. Is the current system as efficient/good as it gets or do you think there's space for improvement here? I get how making these quick decisions can help, especially with the rising percentages of pet ownership and, I assume, the implicitly increased required minimum capacity for a practice. Am I understanding right if I'm seeing that you're using ezyVet's customisation to match up your shape/colour/etc system with what is on the PMS? This also helped me understand that ezyVet's tabs are intimidating-looking but highly intuitive because they're structured from big concepts to small details as opposed to just being an assortment of random stuff.Ah yes, printer issues. The bane of anyone's existence. I can never get the buggers to work right. Rude little devices. With formatting and HTML, do you think a no-code visual builder will help? Not just block-based but one where you can just drop a block in its suggested location and then drag&drop to where it needs to be? No more margins, paddings, and `position: relative;` to worry about, just WYSWIG.About the financial permissions, would retroactive discounts be the only thing you'd keep to yourself? I can get why that one should need approval but I'm struggling to come up with more examples that aren't hindsight vision corrections of invoices etc.I'm glad to hear you're happy with ezyVet. I've struggled with finding software that works with me too (code editors, visual design tools, etc.) so I can get that feeling you get when it all just clicks into place. Maybe once I have a product ready I'll be able to change your mind 😂.It's also good to hear the no-admin is more common than I expected. This means small practices also get to benefit from PMS' (if they can afford them from what I'm reading). It's also good to see a feeling of community. I've read a bunch of articles about vet burnout etc so that feeling must be super important.Thanks again for your tips and knowledge. This really helps and I've gotten so many insights from this. I can tell you're experienced with this and I'm glad I got to talk to you about it. It's super exciting stuff. I'm still nailing down the specifics of my idea but once I do get them and come out with something, I hope you'll hear about it through the grapevine.|Thanks for chiming in! My idea is a cheaper $15ish per user plan up to X users for smaller practices with features that they need most and then $25-50 for larger practices with stuff for bigger businesses like multi-location support (ie. multiple buildings or something along these lines?) etc. I'd want it to put the smaller practices first because of the current vet group acquisition movement that's going on.Wow, that sounds like a horrible and unacceptable process. I get now why this process is something so many people are reserved towards. Data loss during system migration is horrible and pretty much the worst case scenario imho. That's subpar and I wouldn't want that to happen. The only troubleshooting that should be going on (in my head) is when you actually switch. It should be just done with afterwards.Again, thanks for saying all of that. It's been super helpful in getting why migration is a big scary thing. That definitely sounds like a program issue from the PMS' side. Seems like I could do better here because really coding something that doesn't lose species data during migration isn't a super complex task. They should be doing much better.This also ties into why I'm considering doing this. I work at the cutting edge of software and it's horrifying to hear that you guys have to deal with stuff I've seen as a thing of the past for a good while now. Crazy to think we have ChatGPT, GPUs that can do math faster than the collective brainpower of humanity, and PMS software that can't copy labwork and species data correctly.",,,,,

2711,Naamch3,2,"Imposter syndrome sure seems to hit a greater # of people in this recent crop of college grads. I wonder why? But for your purposes please don’t let it stop you. Most others in a range of graduating years near you had the Covid impact as well. I have two suggestions. #1 pursue your dream vet job and let nothing stop you…especially yourself. You will grow old regretting it. Knowing you gave up on your dream b/c you lacked confidence will gnaw at you forever and could destroy your mental health over time. Once you get your vet job and are treating patients I doubt the vet practice will allow you to be a sole decision maker on critical cases at first. You and they will want to have an experienced voice in both diagnosis then treatment. Also, be open during your interview. Let them know how much you want the job and ask about mentorship.  Like any medical position a credible veterinary practice will want to assess you before they allow you to fly solo. It might help if you interview at larger practices where they might have more mentoring options. Be upfront about your nervousness. They will appreciate it and tell you that it is normal. If you get an offer from a veterinary practice that doesn’t give you the confidence that there will be mentorship as well as various checks to ensure you cause no outlandish harm then just keep interviewing. Please don’t let that voice in your head cause you to take a desk job and god forbid you take a government job. That sounds like a recipe for a lifetime of regret and pain. I don’t know you but I assume you are better than a government job.Option #2, if you really are paralyzed by your imposter syndrome then what about interviewing for nurse or technician jobs at vet practices? Or vet / doctor assistant? I apologize for not knowing the right vocabulary for these positions. Sure the pay won’t be what you could make as a veterinary doctor but it provides for a slower start and a longer runway to get your feet under you. As for the economics, assuming the ‘nurse’ job builds you into having the confidence to flip to veterinary doctor then the lifetime earnings will far exceed the giving up option of pursuing that banal government desk job.Hope this was helpful. A rule of thumb I often use is this, you have only two people in this world to make proud of you. Those two people are your eight year old self and your eighty year old self.

Having said that, I have also been practicing for 9 years now and really enjoy being a vet. I’m not going to say it is easy but it does get easier with time. Sometimes I think of it as being in “doctor mode” during work- sort of like acting like someone else if that makes sense? I have worked with many vets that have similar personalities traits that are amazing doctors and clients feel at ease with them, so you don’t have to be an extrovert to succeed! I would be happy to share more if you are interested! Good luck and don’t worry, you’ve got this!|Any chance they could show you numbers from previous years? That might give you an idea of what to expect. Even better if they can give you an idea of what they are doing to advertise the new hospital etc. If you are invested in this, there are things that you could do personally as well. I have unfortunately been in a similar situation and did end up leaving because I could not meet production due to an empty schedule/high cancellation rates. I would be happy to chat more if you are interested. Good luck!|I think it depends on what your goal for your career is. If you really enjoy surgery then a shelter job would definitely be a good fit. However if you want to improve on your medicine skills, a shelter job might not give you the exposure you need. A good GP would actually be able to help you with both and eventually make you a more well-rounded vet. Being willing to do surgery in a GP setting is a definite need these days… I find more and more recent grads not wanting to do surgery for various reasons, so that could work in your favor. It’s true that mentorship these days is not quite like what it used to be. If you would like to I would be happy to share more of my experiences. I’ve been in small animal GP for 9 years and have done relief work in lots of different types of clinics so definitely understand how important it is to find a place that matches your goals.

What makes this the practice or specialty for you? What do you find most difficult and most rewarding here?  What did you try that you did not like and why? Maybe you will end up in a specialty like dermatology where patients rarely die, and the people who stick with their care are devoted to them. Maybe you will end up in shelter medicine, where there are happy adoptions and fewer grieving owners among the sad stories. Maybe you will carve out your own niche. The opportunities are many.

There may be a skilled and trained staff member to cover those consultations, but it is a big askIMHO, it would be possible to build a practice around hospice, with a few caveats. You would have to be willing and able in your area to charge what your time is worth. It would have to be at least part-time mobile, to do household and lifestyle management consultations justice.You would have to build a very trusting relationship with local practitioners and specialists. It would be vital to getting referrals. You would also have to figure out how much monitoring you could do without alienating them, and how often you would have to defer to having the primary do the lab work and imaging. You would have to have a partner clinic as a base, or ‘visiting’ privileges worked out with the primary for if/when hospitalization were needed. You would have to figure out a way to get the patients home treatment, where the owners were not able to do it but are willing to pay. This might be your staff or working with the primary clinic’s staff to set up home care. The emotional toll would be immense. You would be bonding with animals who are going to die imminently and the people who love them. You would need to be available pretty much 24/7. For me, I might see providing hospice care as part of a high-end, high quality mobile practice, but not as a full time gig.

Our DVMs are incredible and I admire their work. I’ve said goodbye to many of my own pets over the years - always at a clinic or an ER. This past December I scheduled in-home hospice for my dog, Roxxie. We were able to get her on meds to make her comfortable and set up a plan for her care. We were connected with a hospice nurse and the doctor checked in regularly. I was able to plan for Roxxie’s euthanasia at home and it was a beautiful and peaceful experience. We gave her all of the food she couldn’t have during her life (chocolate cake, cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, etc.) and she was around her family and our other pets. The doctor gave Roxxie a subQ sedative while she was laying on her favorite couch with our other dog next to her. The doctor waited until Roxxie was fully sedated before placing an IVC and euthanizing her. My sister and I carried Roxxie out to the doctor’s car and covered her with her favorite blanket.I am very close with several of our DVMs and they love what they do. Most of them work four to five days in a row and have said having two or three days off in a row in the best way for them to decompress. Some of our DVMs have never worked in a clinic and went straight to end-of-life care after graduating. If you have the passion for hospice and euthanasia, you’d probably find a position like that very fulfilling. Again- I’m definitely not a veterinarian and I’m sorry that was so long. Good luck in whatever you decide! ♥️Edited for spelling.",,,,,

There was some prejudice against island students from staff (more technicians than anyone) but the admin during my year have Island students the same name badges as us Purdue students so it was harder to determine. Most rotations are very work-like hours. Internal medicine, surgery, and emergency/critical care rotations have the longest hours, sometimes with night treatments. Learning about other schools now, I’d say Purdue often uses its fourth year vet students as cheap tech labor. On one hand you do get some decent training and exposure to more cases. On the other hand doing eye drops in ECC at 11pm isn’t really what you as a vet will be doing post graduation. So look at the treatment plans of your patients and try and understand the whys. A lot too depends on how helpful your blockmates are and teamwork. My blockmates were always great about pitching in to get things done. I really enjoyed my Ancillary rotation. The hours were great and the workload wasn’t over the top and we saw a lot of sad, but interesting cases. My poultry rotation was probably my favorite, but I dont really see chickens anymore.

Early in your career, you should be focusing on applying what you learned in vet school to real world cases, and your employer should be focused on training and mentoring you.  All of those processes (when done successfully) take time away from your caseload and therefore negatively affect productivity.But, if you insist, then standard 21% production means you should be bringing in between about $480K/year in receipts (for $100K salary) and $720K/year (for $150K salary), which is close to the salary range we typically offer new grads.  Individual hospitals will have differing policies on which line items count toward production - frequently, things like prescription diets, technician appointments, and medication refills are excluded from that total.  Veterinarians who perform surgery and dentals will generally have an easier time making those production goals, although it can be done with a busy medical-only schedule.Good luck in your career development!|It's not really that different from a pervasive attitude in human medicine - a pill to treat symptoms of a disease is often preferred to intentional, inconvenient lifestyle changes that may fix the problem altogether.",,,,,

Quite a few of my partner's vet school classmates are in their mid, late 30's when they began school so it's very much possible.The biggest hurdle I'd assume, would be getting accepted into Veterinary school, but once you're in, it's doable! You'll need a strong and convincing application package, admissions is VERY competitive simply due to the limited number of Veterinary schools compared to other professions. Work experience can definitely contribute to the admission requirements.If you haven't done undergrad yet, then yea, getting your bachelor's first will make a huge difference with vet school admission regardless.I'd say in summary: you'll likely know your answer when you get accepted or rejected into the vet school(s) you apply to.

I will say from what I've gathered from the pre-vet and vet students I've mentored over the past few years, schools have gotten increasingly more strict about GPA cutoffs. When I was applying, Davis (my undergrad alma mater) was already implementing automatic cutoffs for students whose GPAs were less than 3.5.  It was the first school to reject me and it felt almost instantaneous :(I got into Western (Pomona) on my first try at age 23 and at the time, they were fairly non-traditional and were very much more interested in admitting students with a variety of experiences. Age discrimination was definitely not a thing, my classmates' ages ranged from 21 to 48. I can safely say that my GPA was not the deciding factor for my admittance, they were way more interested in my research experience and I'm confident that was why they accepted me.

This applies especially to some of these newer groups that started with venture capitalists, most have no experience in vet med.  The corp that I worked for was so hands off that their regional manager wasn't allowed to visit more than once a quarter unless it was a crisis.  What this does is create unfamiliarity to each clinic and wasted time describing needs and wants over and over again.  What they do know is how to buy a clinic, not improve or maintain it beyond basic management or lobby face lifts.Another thing to keep in mind is a lot of these hands off corporations don't change previous clinic benefits, so the benefits could vary from clinic to clinic.  This is great during the beginning buyout because nothing really changes, but it also eludes any infrastructure to create a plan to improve benefits.  Wild situations of staff getting a 5k a year bonus vs a larger clinic handing out $100, differences in how staff discounts are applied, etc.  They keep clinics where they were when they bought them out.  Getting improvements in benefits outside of what the Corp allows all clinics is impossible, even when other clinics could have better benefits than the others.  To be clear, you don't want red tape and micro management in your practice, but at the end of the day the corps will demand the price increases and dictate raise allowances with practices they have no idea who they are.  Clinics that need a lot of help don't get the support they need and you tend to compete for staff with sister clinics in the area.I've never worked with a bigger Corp like VCA or Banfield, so this could be the same across the board, but keep in mind hands off doesn't mean better in all circumstances.|Olympia veterinarian here, you'll make more than 100k a year no problem.

Clamps can spread the pedicle quite wide, so if you tie too close to it the ligature might initially be tight but the pedicle shrinks once you remove the clamp and the ligature slips. Try shimmying the knot down a little bit or making sure you have a good crush to tie.I am a double-ligater too, and I tend to do my first knot further down the pedicle (sometimes without clamping depending on fat) and tighten it down but don't crank it if I am worried about it tearing.

They are significantly cheaper though.|EVERYONE has rough spays. It may be ""routine"" but it is a major surgery! There aren't too many others we do in GP that involve removal of an entire abdominal organ.Try to refocus on what went well. You made a successful abdominal approach. You found the uterus. You isolated the ovaries, pedicles and body, and removed them. You identified the problem, explored the abdomen, appropriately monitored the patient after the complication, and the patient went home safely.

So it really is worth buying one. You can gimmick the materials they provide but there's not much to replace the thousands of practice questions they have. Also, take ICVA practice tests to know where you stand. There are 3 of them, only one allows you to see which questions you got wrong, and the others just give a score.

A 'vet tech' is a veterinary technician, there are two common types, licensed and unlicensed. Licensed 'vet techs' have gone to a veterinary technician school, have taken an exam, and passed, they are equivalent to being a registered nurse in the vet world. Depending on the state and hospital, unlicensed 'techs' are trained on the job and may have little to no educational training at all, it's just a title to show seniority; some states or practices won't allow someone who has not been licensed to have the 'veterinary technician' title. Unlicensed vet techs are actually vet assistants but that title (in my and most people's opinion) feels too low for all they do; after all, they are not the type of assistant you see on TV who just gets coffee.In the US, Veterinarians go to Vet school for 4 years only AFTER completing a bachelor's degree for 4 years; I know some countries have 6-year programs you can directly enter after high school (or equivalent). Depending on the country and the type of vet school you go to (6 year vs others) the AVMA may or may not allow you to sit for the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE). This is the big exam that allows you to practice in the US. I know some countries are can take another exam (the Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Equivalence PAVE), complete a clinical year in the US, and then take the NAVLE.Go online to AVMA's website and I think you should find info relevant to your situation there, or be able to contact someone who knows more! I hope this helps!|Someone already said it, but you have to already have the Doctor degree or equivalent (or about to receive it in the final year as a student) before you can take the NAVLE. You can graduate and have the Doctor title but you can't practice medicine without taking the NAVLE. You could teach, work in research, or similar things without passing the NAVLE but you can't see patients or do medicine without the NAVLE.The NAVLE is only for Doctors. Licensed Vet techs take a different exam called the VTNE.|Sorry this ended up being very lengthy!1. while you are in high school do well enough to get accepted into a decent university and have an overall good GPA to help with this. A lot of universities offer different pre-veterinary degrees that you should go for. These (in theory) will make sure you get all of the required classes to apply to vet school. Make sure to take a ton of science classes and make sure to do really really well in them. Take as many credit hours (classes) as you are allowed. Vet schools want to see that you do really good in science, and that you can handle 6/7+ classes a semester, because that is what you will be doing if you get accepted. 2. We are all burnt out and struggling mentally, but it is otherwise very rewarding. Take an interest in mental health and caring for your own mental well-being, you will have to do that a lot, especially in vet school. it is also worth noting that the vet world seems to be looking up. the older vets are all still depressed and struggling, but the new generation doesn't seem to be as bad (or maybe that is my experience)3. to put some big scary numbers to it: the AVMA (American veterinary medical association) releases statistics yearly about the state of Vet Med. This year average student debt for vet school alone was $145,000. Starting Salaries were around 115,000/year for new grads. These are very subjective depending on where you go and other things, but these numbers are looking better than they did in the past. Also keep in mind that there is not a ton of upward movement to salaries over time, or there hasn't been in the past. Offset your tuition cost by going to an in-state school (the vet school in the state you live in, or a vet school that contracts with your state to provide in-state tuition to a certain number of students form your school), living modestly and not paying the highest rent around, scholarships, savings, dont take any grad plus loans, etc. 4. some schools do track for large animal or small animal vets, but the NAVLE (licensing exam) is over everything and majority small animal, so most teach everything and you can go into one vs the other later. Also salaries for large animal vets are much lower than small animal vets.",,,,,

And pay for our veterinary nurses is not enough.|I’m starting my surgical residency this year. I was an out of state student at Kansas state and tuition was about 55k a year when I started in 2015 and went up each year. Plus I needed additional money for rent and living.

Thankfully COVID stopped interest from compounding during my internships, but even now on my IBR plan, I’m not even touching the principal let alone the interest (7% interest on 340k is about 2000 / month) - so the interest keeps compounding onto the principle balance and that’s how you get fucked. I’d have to be paying 3900k a month to try to pay it off in ten years. Thanks for making me do math this early :)|Yeah my life is fairly chaotic.

I promise you, there are good owners and good clinics out there that you should definitely explore before giving up on general practice altogether.  As far as this nasty boss being intent on burning you out during your 2 month notice, I would recommend 2 things. First, if you have an employment contract, re-read it very carefully. There is likely some language in there regarding a ""reasonable workload"" or something very similar. With all of the stress, anxiety and mental health problems you have accumulated since starting this position, I feel you would have a strong legal case to say your workload is unreasonable for someone of your experience level.  Secondly, I would definitely chat with an employment lawyer. I noticed you're in Canada in another comment, I know the OVMA provides free initial legal consults, I'm sure other provinces associations have something similar, if not, pay a few hundred dollars to talk to an employment lawyer. This should give you a more finite idea of the actual repercussions of leaving before your notice period is up.  I'm sorry this has happened to you, but just know this is not a reflection of you, but a reflection on a greedy unempathetic owner.",,,,,

Don't take on debt of that magnitude.

I sat down with them and planned out housing costs, food costs, tuition, etc... during school, and then what loans of that magnitude would mean upon graduation, especially if they wanted to come back to BC (where housing costs are insane) to practice. Both realized that given the average salary for vets here, financially it wasn't worth it. One is now happily in another non-veterinary professional school, and the other went to college for a human health care program that has a similar salary after graduation with far less debt and time in school.  There are so many of us who are dissatisfied with the profession, and I know a lot of veterinarians who have left or pursued lower-paying, non-clinical roles. But my colleagues who have that huge debt load seem especially worse off, especially concerning their mental health, as they can't afford to explore other options.

2894,Self-Taught-Pillock,2,"It depends on the practice and also the area. I didn’t work in veterinary medicine too long, but the practice that employed me made it a condition of my employment that my tattoos (pet-related tattoos) were covered while on site. It’s important to note that while such a requirement seems stuffy and of outdated sentiments, they didn’t have a moment’s hesitation hiring me or anyone with tattoos. They only wanted them covered. At the very most, I believe that’s what you’re facing: merely covering tattoos instead of not being hired because of them.Most practices don’t care. I had tattooed acquaintances at other practices in this rather religious and conservative area that didn’t have to cover, even one with a septum piercing that wasn’t required to hide it. And long after I left veterinary medicine, I had to take my own little baby dog to a specialist clinic for a hemilaminectomy, and the specialist clinic (that had about 50-60% Mormon clientele) had plenty of tattooed employees that weren’t required to cover while at work.What people will notice and remember is the light in your eyes.",,,,,

If there is a ton of extravagant or unenforceable content and it's your first job and you didn't seek counsel, no judge would enforce it.

2926,step1step2profit,2,"For cardio, the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program. I haven't been in the match for awhile, but it seems like interns from CSU, Tufts, Ohio, TAMU, NC State, and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency. So I can't answer your question about externship vs research program directly; go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship.That being said, while it's great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career, make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship. Your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician. It's also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects, not just cardiology. The specialty world is small and it is not uncommon for residency committees to reach out to friends in non-cardiology specialists to ask about candidates (unofficially).",,,,,

I've also only been in this industry for a few months.that being said, in this time (I work at an urgent care) I've seen two vets cry due to completely heart wrenching cases.first case was with a new-to-us vet. this case was not euthanasia, but unfortunately ended similarly. the dog came in limping. we'd administered pain meds via IV (iirc) and the dog immediately went into arrest. we attempted CPR but were unsuccessful. when we broke the news to his owner, it was gut wrenching. we were all in tears because it was completely unexpected. Dr later says he believes the limping was due to a clot and we may have unfortunately pushed the clot out of position while giving meds leading to cardiopulmonary arrest.second case was a euth. an older dog came in because she got cut on the farm. she was a ""farm dog"". at the point the finally came in, she'd been bleeding for over five hours and had stalled her owners T-shirt in an attempt to help her clot. our DR was immediately suspicious and asked about rat poison. owner called a family member who was able to check and she did unfortunately get into it. while we were waiting to hear back from ASPCA poison control so we could transfer her to ER, our DR was demonstrating how to use an ultrasound for a new tech. The DR realized there was a lot of free-floating liquid in her abdomen. Dr asked to do an X-ray because she was older and intact. She unfortunately had pyometra. However, the owner was willing to pay for the expensive surgery, so she is good, right? wrong. by happenstance, the X-ray also captured nodes on her lungs. the owner had no idea she had cancer. this case was heart wrenching because despite our best efforts and an owners willingness to do whatever it took to get her better, she wouldn't be able to do so. in the end, we were all feeling it because it felt like everything was against this sweet girl getting better.my point here is it is normal to have emotions in this job. we can't always be stoic like it doesn't affect us. those emotions make us human and show we care about the animals we are looking after.",,,,,

2974,Katmaybeck,2,"I became a licensed vet tech in 2016 and I worked for Banfield for 2 years as one of my first jobs. Sure I gained a tremendous amount of experience but also became aware of the sketchy malpractice the vets were doing there. They had really weak anesthetic protocols and literally used TORB/MIDAZ premed for every surgery- spay, neuter, dentals, even tho butorphanol has the weakest analgesia and they were afraid of using hydromorphone thinking it was this scary drug when in fact it is an excellent choice for premed sedation and pain control. I witnessed so many pets waking up in pain bc the vets follow a cookie cutter formula and are afraid to practice quality medicine. They never educated the owners or showed them the teeth in the room so they were clueless on day of dental, no forewarning on what periodontal disease is. They waited until pet under and charted to try to call and often the client had no idea they needed to be available so they wouldn’t answer and we would have to wake up the pet. If the owner did happen to answer, the conversation was always a surprise for the client, they would be shocked at the extra cost and decline bc they don’t understand they needed “additional services”. If the vets did their job and educated and provided estimates prior there would be a lot more compliance and quality treatment, but not the case here. There was one doctor that hated dentals and extractions so much he would purposely avoid contacting the owner about the periodontal disease. He would call once and then immediately tell me to turn off when they didn’t answer, did not wait 5 min or try again. One time he waited until after I took my 1 hr lunch and came back to take his, even tho we were supposed to lunch together and do another dental after bc it was a longer one. Well he was trying to stall for time to avoid having to do extractions. I had to advocate for the pet and tell him the owner requested full mouth dental X-rays (even tho I had convinced her to do them at check in bc they were not included at the time for Banfield dentals). Well lo and behold the dog had like 9 tooth root abscesses and he is immediately pissed that he has to start pulling teeth. We of course don’t finish in time and have to wake up without doing them all. Another time I was cleaning/charting and told him both back molars were a little loose. He comes and checks them and think one is more loose than the other but I didn’t agree. Well he just decides to pick up the drill and start taking out this tooth without consent from owner, no dental block that I recall, and just did it in a forceful way out of anger. It was extremely alarming…They do assembly line exams where they would just flip the lip of the canine tooth and that was it. Didn’t do a thorough check of back teeth or incisors which are often worse in small dogs. Even the medical director was in it for the money. She did the fastest “exams” I’ve ever seen and did not chart dentals properly. One time a relief vet was there and was saying how she always counts the teeth and discovered the 311 was dead but the medical director does not normally chart that thoroughly and seemed surprised (but actually this relief vet was doing her job properly and how it should be). Another time the medical director refused to provide solutions for this Yorkie with a heart murmur and horrible teeth bc she was “not gonna risk putting it under”. But heart murmur is not an automatic disqualification from anesthesia. She could have referred to specialty dentist. I took it upon myself to leave her a voicemail with information if she wanted to see a cardiologist/specialist bc the pet was suffering and needed full mouth extractions. But the vets didn’t care about the pets pain and oral disease there. Before they installed the digital dental X-rays we had analog and had to use dip tanks so we would rarely take them. I remember cleaning pets teeth with severe gingival recession, very deep pockets and furcation exposure. And we would just clean them and wake up. These same pets got dentals here for years and then when we finally get X-rays discover 9 tooth abscess. So imagine how many pets were never getting proper extractions of diseased teeth and just getting them “cleaned”. That does not get rid of the pain and infection so those pets all continued to suffer from Banfield their whole lives!! Sadly this is not just a Banfield problem, but a nationwide problem for practices that still do not offer digital dental X-rays OR who still think it’s ok to take dental X-rays “as needed” when they think a tooth is bad. But in reality X-rays are the only way to diagnose pathology 100% so don’t go anywhere that doesn’t take full mouth X-rays for every dental!I soon after found a veterinary dental practice and left Banfield. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work there or bring their pet there. I felt the pets were neglected in the kennels for hours, received incomplete physical exams and substandard treatment in general. The whole culture of Banfield is about pushing the most amount of pets to be seen in a day, maximizing the wellness plan signups, and a greedy profit driven agenda. Literally they would post signs on the walls that said “12 drop offs before 12” or something like that. Techs had to often pull blood and place catheters by themselves bc people would call out or quit all the time. It was just utter chaos at all times.Obviously this was a single Banfield horror story but I know it’s not the only one. I also did a relief shift once at another Banfield and it was soooo disorganized and clutter everywhere. They also NEVER entered the lab results for anything in house I noticed- cytologies, skin scrapes, FeLV tests in the computer. I’m not sure how they were able to get by with this?

I think it comes down to narcissism at the end of the day.

However there is alot of on the job experience that only comes with time, wisdom and growth.

So please do not think you are above a tech because you have the title. Respect is earned with experience. Do not be afraid to ask them a question? Or your other colleagues.

3026,Beautiful-Local-6473,2,"FutureHey guys I had written in another post detailing about my aspirations to become a vet one day and especially work more with wildlife, I still wouldn’t mind working with other animals as well. I am currently a senior in undergraduate and my current gpa is 2.44 , I have 2 semesters left , I am expected to graduate fall 2024. I am worried about how my journey is going so far in veterinary medicine because it hasn’t been the best and I will do my best to keep my story short. I relocated to America from Africa at the age of 13 , idk why I didn’t fully quite know I wanted to be a vet , it’s like I always knew deep inside that my fondness for animals is way deeper and I would always go above and beyond taking care of them the best way I knew how to do it since I was young , especially the stray animals back in my country. Anyway after coming to America , I graduated high school with a 3.9 gpa then went to community college for 2 and a half years where I was focused on international relations and international business , I have always been into humanitarian work as well , fast forward my advisor at the college asked me about how come I have never thought about veterinary medicine and all I do is talk about animals , that’s when it clicked to me that I am in the wrong major and I should pursue veterinary medicine , at this point I was like 21/22 years old. So I graduated from the community college with a decent gpa , I believe it was like a 3.4 and then I applied to do animal science pre vet track at the state university then I later changed it to food science pre vet track. My life started going downhill after freshman year of university and I would say that most of my undergraduate life has not been the best , I experienced a lot of racism , loneliness, depression, getting sick etc , just shit happening and I lost control of myself.  life was just hitting me from all sides and as a result of all that I think it was my sophomore year I started drinking a lot and I ended up getting 2 duis 2 years apart, so now I have a class A misdemeanor on my record. I decided to take a break from school and go back to my parents and work on myself and my life and seek therapy etcI actually just resumed school this fall , after taking a break for almost 2 years , while I was on break I worked at the humane society and 2 other vet clinics as a vet assistant and I was full time there so I know I have a lot of hours when it comes to that. I have been seeking therapy and taking the alcohol classes and stuff , I have been sober for almost a year now and I know I still have a journey ahead of me fighting alcohol, I am happy to say that I did really well this semester and after everything I have been through , I do see some hope for me in the future , at the same time with a low gpa and 2 duis , am questioning all that I am currently 27 years old and I know that I really fucked up my undergraduate, sometimes I wish I could go back to freshman year and start all over and make better choices but I never did. So now that I am expected to graduate in a year , I plan to raise my gpa to atleast a 2.8, I met with my pre vet advisor and we discussed taking courses with more weight that would replace the ones I failed which is like 3/4 classes I think , I know the duis are definitely also another hurdle for me in vet school and career world Yes  my story is complicated and fucked up but I am looking for any advice anyone has to give me out there, anyone with similar experience or know anyone who has 2 DUIs and got into vet school or became a vet Although 27 feels old and that am super behind , I also know am still young and I don’t plan to apply for vet school anytime soon, I figured I should give it atleast another 2/3-4 years from now especially with my duis I am currently stuck on what should I do after getting my bachelors ? Should I just go straight to the work force or pursue a masters and what trajectory should I take so that I can be considered a candidate for veterinary medicine in the future or should I just kiss all of it goodbye since I have no chance whatsoever? Also my advisor told me that getting into vet school might be possible in the future but getting a dea license is where things might be challenging. We did a little research on it and we saw that if you are a felon then you are already disqualified from getting it or you would need to plead your case but with a misdemeanor and depending on how long ago it was , there’s a slight hope there but it varies case by case. So I know that all of these things won’t be easy for me and I have a lot of hurdles and challenges to overcome in the future. However am willing to do all it takes to get there one day even if it will take me the next 8-10 years of my life. I love animals so much and I grew up around so many stray animals and my own pets and also wildlife so I don’t know what else I would do with my life if not taking care and being there for animals. Any advice is much appreciated|Thank you so much for this advice ❤️",,,,,
3027,Feral80s_kid,2,"There’s so many avenues! You could work in a rehabilitation practice, or a holistic practice, for example.|Ask around as far as what type/amount of support team you’ll have also!

And when we’re in lab situations with live animals, I would tell them, “This is your safe space to make mistakes.

You can go volunteer with animals in your free time.|To add context to my comment, I’m a recent animal science graduate that found 2 jobs post college, none of which would pay a livable wage. The first one was 19/h which is at least somewhat livable (maybe lol) but the second was 16.50 💀💀 they expect you to sell your soul to the devil for this job, yet I was told by many technicians at my former job that they are expected to do far more than a regular human nurse. In my opinion, physician assistant or nursing sounds great if you don’t want to pursue med school. Nursing is great because you start out with a decent pay after acquiring a 4 year degree and there is room for growth if you want to pursue higher education. And this is just my personal opinion again, but I find that most people in vet med don’t actually respect animals as much as you’d think or their passion sort of dies out once they have to live the everyday life. They are so overworked and underpaid and expected to keep up with everything from rude clients to those who don’t want what’s best for their pets to animals they simply can’t help to euthanasia and just a whole other lot of concerns. That’s honestly mostly why I walked away. You try to convince yourself that you’re okay with the pay but at the very least, you don’t even get respect for your otherwise very difficult job. Unless you’re 1000% sure this is what you want and you won’t get the same (if not better) fulfillment working with animals outside of your daily job, explore other medical fields first before you commit.|Tbh if you’re willing to go to vet school, just go to med school instead. I began college as a pre med and ended it as a pre vet. But if there was a part of me that was passionate about human medicine I would have 1000% done that instead. You get far more money and respect for your work. You don’t have to kill your patients and you can call the child protective services if someone is deliberately holding off medical treatment for their children. You can truly advocate for your patients and the law will be on your side because your patients are human beings and not animals (who have the same right as a handbag as far as the law is concerned). There’s so much to note here but the bottom line is: if you like medicine and you enjoy working with humans, attend med school or some other health profession that will pay you far more for your work anyway.

3048,HiddenJindo,2,"Hello! Veterinary medicine is an incredibly rewarding career but, in most cases, clinical medicine is quite busy. A successful, well-functioning clinic is typically a busy clinic. It is good that you have had clinical experience already! There are options for lowering your workload but it depends on where you're working, the type of work you're doing, and how much control you have over your schedule.As far as the US Army HPSP scholarship, financially it is a great deal. The scholarship pays for 3 years of veterinary school. At the same time, you are paid a monthly stipend of \~$2000 per month (greatly varying by your location). In exchange you owe 4 years active duty to the US Army.An army veterinarian is a unique job. The primary clinical focus of the army veterinarian is to support the health of the military working dog (MWD). The typical army veterinarian performs less clinics than a civilian veterinarian because they will also spend their time doing other tasks such as auditing food facilities (ice cream facilities, bottled water plants, etc) that sell to the military. The history of army veterinarians performing food protection dates back to a time where the Army shipped cadavers (e.g. cattle) by rail as a primary food source for soldiers, and veterinarians were able to judge if animal meat was still consumable or not after transport. Army veterinarians also deploy and provide humanitarian relief.Depending on where you are assigned in the army, you may do a mix of medicine and food work, or all food work, or all army work. It is a very real possibility that an army veterinarian attached to a deployable unit does not touch an animal patient for 2-3 years.This fact is a big negative to many army veterinarians who originally became veterinarians because they wanted to work on animals, haha. At the end of the day, I think becoming an Army veterinarian for the financial benefits is still worth it because of the incredible cost of veterinary school. But it's important to understand the cost of becoming one, and the resulting time you may lose to 'develop' yourself as a clinician. It's also helpful if you have a personal desire to serve in the military, and not just because you're motivated by the financial benefits.Feel free to reply or DM me if you'd like to discuss this career further!Source: am a 1st year army veterinarian.",,,,,

3050,booboobewwy,2,"Hi! I recently graduated in August 2023 with a BS in Animal Science and microbiology minor. My undergrad gpa is a 3.33 but I have not calculated my science or last 45 gpa. It would probably be around 3.0 - 3.1 area. Most of my C’s were from my advanced microbio courses taken for my minor during Covid online. I also got a C in Ochem II and physics II. My grades aren’t the best but I have a variety of experience. I’m currently an intern at an AZA zoo in their veterinary department and will end up with around 600 hours after I finish in a few months. I have 330 hours from being an intern at a marine mammal rehab center, 550 hours from being a fellow at a wildlife rehabilitation center, 800 hours from a small cat/dog clinic as a veterinary assistant/receptionist, so about 2200 veterinary hours. I also worked at a small non-profit farm and have about 300 hours, 700 hours working as a kennel attendant, so about 1000 non-veterinary animal hours. In addition, I have about 400 hours working in the food industry, 200 animal care volunteer hours from 2 different aquariums and a wildlife center, and 400 hours working as a laboratory assistant (basically almost like a TA) at my school and helped prepare for all the biological science courses. I will probably have atleast 400 more animal hours by the time I apply, after I finish up with my current internship and get a job somewhere else. I live in Cali and only feel like my only chance is getting into Western. I also don’t want to apply to Caribbean schools but open to some international schools.

Also, try to call or email local clinics and ask if there is any openings or even opportunities to shadow. Shadowing can be a starting point to land a paying job once they get to know you more and you showed the passion. Also, volunteering does not have to be full time if you need another job to support yourself, and most clinics don't take volunteers anyway due to liability issues. Volunteering will likely take place in nonprofits or animal shelters, some may have paying positions such as internships or clinic/office assistant jobs. I got my first VA job when I was in college volunteering for an aniaml shelter (later I received an internship offer at the same facility). I emailed the lead veterinarian for a chance to shadow and I got put to work on the spot lol. I understand finance can be hard at times because you just graduated and have no other source of income. But for veterinary experience, sometimes you have to focus on getting the experience rather than making money as the industry itself does not have high profit margin either.

Your experience hours and letters of rec are going to be your strong suits in this case. I took a year off to knock out my pre-reqs, and only my pre-reqs. I don't even have a bachelor's degree.

While some may be content not being evidence based in their decisions I think that brings you closer to the shamans, voodoo, thoughts and prayers, BS that we should be avoiding.|At least you admit the bias. Our goal should be understanding our biases and being conscious of how they are guiding our choices. Your example has a pretty clear explanation. The vast majority of acute diarrhea resolves on its own without any intervention, therefore if metro is routine prescribed then the vast majority of cases get better but not BECAUSE of metro. The change to bland diets and probiotics doesn’t have an inherently lower chance of resolution (in fact studies suggest otherwise) but it does have the downside of the owners and practitioners knowing there is the possibility of metro. My bias and hypothesis is that when owners are given a medication for a symptom they are far more willing to continue it for the course of the prescription before returning(7-10 days for metro do instance) compared to diet and probiotic change people call in 2 days saying diarrhea is still going on and they want something else. When we then give them metro we see resolution not because of the drug but because of the time. I’m guilty of treating the owner more than the pet similar to the example you mention, but the change in mind frame of the practitioner needs to be clear. Metro isn’t being prescribed because it’ll work better or faster in those cases(there is no evidence to support that assumption), it is being given to assuage the owner and prevent them from being a nuisance by giving them something to do for a predetermined length of time. When you think about it in that way you realize that it is an intellectually and ethically flawed decision.|I mean dogs can still get buprenorphine it’s just expensive. Tylenol alone is just so-so but Tylenol with codeine is an option. A recent neurology CE I went to recommended codeine for neck and back pain. I’ve used it a handful of times and been content. Also I feel like we’re a bit too hesitant with NSAIDs in general, I’d suggest that if pain management is truly a concern, the small risk of the NSAID is worth it.

3136,PurplePotatoCat,2,"Ask your clinic about a dosimeter badge to measure the amount of radiation you’re being exposed to taking x-rays. Ideally every clinic should have them, and every employee should have their own badge. Try to rotate who takes x-rays to limit exposure. Wear you’re PPE including gloves. Stay out of the primary beam. Use sedation, then you can typically move further away, and get quality x-rays the first shot instead of having to take multiple because of movement etc. Collimate the xray, don’t get the whole pet when the point of interest is a paw. I’m sure their are more tips.

I have about $320K in student loan debt, with about $20K from undergrad. Majority of my classmates have similar debt. My current salary is $100K per year not including monthly production bonus which ranges from about $500- $3K or higher per month based on if I took vacation, if we have a full schedule etc. I also work maybe 2-3 relief shifts per month where that extra pay I split between loans and a high yield savings account. I graduated with $360K student loans with a $13K private loan that I have paid off. While I do overall stress about my student loans, I have had no problem making my payments and it isn’t a significant source of stress on a day to day. I feel like I have a pretty good quality of life, I don’t splurge often but I can buy nice things if I wanted. That being said, I’m married (my husband is currently between jobs and going back to school), we do not have children or any medical problems. I do not live above my means. I grew up kinda poor and I am used to living without. I live more comfortably now than I did ever growing up. So while being in debt is not ideal, it also isn’t the end of the world if you truly want this job. Granted that is different for everyone. If debt is going to really stress you out then for sure look at other options, but unfortunately being a vet typically means going into debt unless your family is well off. Majority of veterinarians are in large amounts of debt, it is terrible but it is also probably not changing anytime soon.|Ooooh, they don’t offer deferment while you’re in school?

I'm going to echo what everyone else here has said - no amount of experience in the veterinary field is going to make up for a subpar GPA in admission's eyes. Struggling financially for a few years while you try to apply isn't going to help you in any sense - getting into vet school, getting in a better financial situation, preserving your mental health. It also isn't going to change anything about your application from year to year except that your experience hours will go up, which probably doesn't buy you anything - I suspect that you already have enough experience there that they'll give you sufficient ""points"" in that category as it is.I'd definitely look for ways to address the GPA issue. What your GPA actually looks like and where you want to apply will probably direct the way you can most effectively do that, but you want to at least consider some possibilities there.But I'd also give serious thought to changing jobs. Either work as a tech somewhere else if you're able to get a greater diversity of experience that way (say, going from a small animal clinic to one that does production animals/horses/exotics/something else), or change careers entirely. Vet med is primarily a business involving people, so anything that broadens your experience with business and/or people is incredibly valuable in an applicant, even if it isn't vet-related. It also makes you stand out against the thousands of applicants they get from adequate-to-good students who've spent years working as techs.No need to continue to suffer just to pursue this dream.

I hired 3 DVMs 6-7 months ago(1 mentor, 2 new grads) and they have been excelling as professionals. The ideals and culture they promote and talk about... They actually follow.Look, let's be real. Corporate is corporate. They're there to make money, like any other business. Private practice is becoming difficult to sustain in the markets that have been molded post pandemic. There's more financial security with the structure of the model they've created. At the end of the day, it's not that I'm pro-corperate, I'm pro-financial security. I live in a major metropolitan area where the cost of living is high and pet ownership is just as important as having a family.

3159,KittyKatOnRoof,2,"Yeah, my biggest critique of a lot of these hospitals is a lack of teaching hospitals. My school has interns, residents, 4th years, 3rd years, and students from the Caribbean schools without a teaching hospital. We barely have the case load and staff to adequately teach these students. Adding more students in classes does nothing to remedy the need for more places to practice and hone clinical skills such as S/N, diagnosis, client communication, etc, etc, etc. Many of these schools have no plans to build a clinical hospital alongside. So their students will be sent in to hospitals that may not be able to adequately teach them. |I would go for cheapest.

If they had access to an environment to help them, they could make a huge impact. But they're hindered by the legalities of operating, using controlled drugs, etc. |Yes!

Working in GP will allow you to broaden your experience further with more complex surgeries and routine vet care. Working in GP will also allow you more time to go back to school if you decide to do so. Now, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go into emergency medicine. I switched from GP to ER 2 years ago and I'll never go back. I'm not licensed (yet), but I still get to do most hands on things, except for what only a licensed tech can do. I focus primarily on inpatient care, so I perform venipuncture, administer medications and treatments, monitor anesthesia, scrub in for surgery, take radiographs, you name it. I make $25 an hour currently and am on track to make $27 by the end of next year.

They even give you explicit directions on the screen when running dilutions. In my clinic we have most of the machines available: catalyst for chemistries/lytes/T4 (takes 10-15 min depending on which tests you’re running), procyte for CBC (takes only a couple minutes), sedivue for UA (I hate the strip reader but LOVE that the sedivue takes pictures of the sample so you can double check for bacteria/crystals/cells- way simpler than staining a UA to read, takes about 5-10 min) , coag for PT/PTT (3-5 min), blood gas values (10 min?? Not as confident on that number because we use it infrequently), and the snap readers. In an ER setting all of them get pretty regular use aside from the blood gas, mostly because the docs just prefer to run those on the istat. With our software, the results connect automatically as well which is really convenient. Idexx customer service is also great- if a slide/cartridge won’t run for some reason on any of the machines (even if there wasn’t enough sample), we can make a note of it and they will refund us for that test.

But think you’ve misinterpreted what I’m saying. My point is that if schools are purely academic, and want to know you can succeed at university level, I just don’t understand how someone with a proven track record of academic success at undergraduate AND postgraduate is somehow LESS competitive than a 17 year old with just predicated high school grades? I am well aware you can’t compare high school in the UK with the North America. I moved to Canada for my undergraduate and had my first year waived because of A-levels. But she isn’t applying to get school here with US high school - she’s applying with a Bachelors and a Masters already in the bag. Surely - from a purely academic standpoint - an A in science courses across undergrad and an A at her postgrad would be far more indicative of academic success than a 17 year old with just 3 A-levels, which are at a lower level than either university degree? That’s what I’m trying to say. If we’re talking academics only. Let alone all the other things! Did you go to an AVMA accredited school? My understanding from this thread is that they are significantly more competitive than non-AVMA schools (and then board exams/process). How are you finding the process for getting accredited to be able to practice in the US/Canada? From the vets she has known who have gone through it, she was put off from non-AVMA schools because she’s seen what a hassle it is.

Every time I had an issue with Idexx, I'd immediately get an email from our rep offering to come in and assist us.

I found once I had 8-12 patients in the whole line (hospitalized, being worked up, waiting), I'd start to feel the panic set in and pause the line until I could deal with what was in front of me then open up again. This was absolutely paramount and I purposely worked there even though it paid less than a clinic 10 minutes more drive the other direction from my house because I wanted that mentorship and support.In terms of case load, I find it's easily 50% what you'd see in GP - vomiting/diarrhea, QOL/euth, eye issues, blocked cats, weed dogs, . 25-ish % is bigger and scarier times - pregnant animals in trouble (I hate dealing with pregnant things and neonates), dog fight wounds, surgical cases (pyos, FBs), resp cats, more potent toxins (Pet Poison Helpline is a life saver), had a seizure but seems ok now. And 25% or less is oh my dog panic - hemoabdomen, GDV, hit by car, drowned in pool, unstoppable seizures, things like that. So it took an adjustment but in the right environment for me it wasn't too bad.

3197,Zestyclose-Row7742,2,"I’m not practicing yet, but I am in school and just finished the acupuncture certification course from Chi. I did the mixed animal track. It is very much eastern medicine and takes a different approach to understanding and describing disease processes. It does not contradict western medicine, but does take a different approach. I have learned to really appreciate integrative medicine and it has helped to shape the direction I would like to go in when I graduate. Personally, doing this track was pretty difficult on top of my course-load, but I am glad I took it. I look forward to being able to practice once I graduate. Also, I’ve had positive feedback from potential employers when I’ve mentioned it. There was also a significant discount for taking the course as a vet student. There are other options for certification; especially if you would prefer a more western approach. I’m not sure if these other institutions also work with vet students, but I think it’s worth looking in to. I would say if you can swing it, go for it.|Hi!

3198,GrapefruitMango23,1,"31 yo female here. I agree that this topic is not nearly touched upon enough given the fact that majority of us are women! I graduated in early 2022 and started working full time as a GP vet. I got pregnant a few months after starting and continued working full time. Management and staff were extremely supportive and lightened my caseload as things became harder physically. I was able to take 4-5 months of maternity leave and currently I am back at work full time. My son is about 10 months old now. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I do agree that it slowed down my career during my time on maternity leave, but when I returned to work, I returned full force and feel that it gave me a new sense of confidence and purpose. This may differ from your experience being that I was a very fresh grad when I got pregnant with little experience out of school, but I think that you having a few years under your belt gives you an added advantage. Regarding whether motherhood has changed my outlook on my career and life, the answer is yes. During school and my first few months out, I was dedicated to the grind and didn’t mind staying late or putting in the extra hours. Now, I ensure that I am efficient during my day and set strict boundaries to leave work at a certain time. I still only get to see my son for about 1-2 hours when I get home to put him to bed. While this truly sucks during the workdays, I appreciate the time spent together so much more on my days off. The time feels more meaningful and I know that my son will one day understand that his mom was out there working hard for him to have a better life. That being said, if I had the opportunity to work part time or full time but three days a week for a similar salary, I would absolutely take it. I am interested in having more kids so we’ll see if all of this holds true! Best of luck and remember to think about the long term.",,,,,

I know I feel that way quite often.Is there a particular reason that you felt your lack of interest was worth sharing?

3215,marwil20,2,"I'm curious how you've got the numbers for the vet school in the UK? Taking Edinburgh as an example, as that's where I study, tuition for starting next year is 37,500 fixed for the entire 5 years (this varies between schools). For living expenses, I would say that I spend less than £10,000 per year, including paying for flights to and from home in the US. That being said, I only go home once per year, round trip flight costing about $800.Between those two figures the total cost (in GBP) is £237500, which at today's exchange rate is about $299,106.83. Taking into account the comment regarding lost earnings, this would push you even further towards coming to the UK. Obviously, the costs will vary between schools, Edinburgh is (I believe) cheaper for tuition, but a medium-high COL, Glasgow and London being far more expensive.I know that you wanted to consider the financial aspects of this choice, but I would also urge you to consider the other aspects of the individual institutions you're applying to. The UK vet degree is an undergrad degree - you get to do societies and sports much more than a US vet degree. I might be biased, but I also think that the education process in the UK is much more collaborative between staff and students than in the US.

Unlike everyone else’s experience, it’s been fine. I don’t we would have survived Covid as smoothly as we did. They buy me pretty much anything I ask for. Wages went up tremendously. They increased prices to clients a ton- now maybe people would argue what is bad, but I’d argue that we’ve been undercharging for our services for eternity and at some point we need to charge appropriately for our skill and services. Yeah it sucks but the cost of EVERYTHING has gone up. A CBC/Chem for the $60 our previous owner was charging wasn’t sustainable. A COHAT at $300 wasn’t going to pay our techs’ salary. I think that was the one thing- some our prices swung too far in the other direction, but they’ve been really receptive to feedback; eg if I think we should charge more for the things that take time and effort and skill and less for the shoppable things that people can get anywhere (like a vaccine or drugs) getting price adjustments has not been difficult. Nobody has EVERY harassed us about our “numbers” explicitly; at MOST it’s been like hey , if a doctor can see two more appointments in a day that would pay for us to get your a virtual scribe so you don’t have to spend as much time doing records.

I also have been practicing, performing and teach improv (for performance) almost just as long. Recently I’ve developed an interest in applied improvisation as it relates to communication in a veterinary hospital setting. 1) in my experience, vet professionals are introverts, for the most part. You always hear folks say they want to work with animals, not people, in the field. I just started at a new hospital and I just ate lunch in a completely silent, yet full, break room. Personally, my experience is with introverts. 2) vet professionals aren’t performers. The work you’re describing in the class is extremely performative, and having a side-coach like that can be very intimidating. I would cry in that class too, and I have decades of experience with both of these things. Personally, I would not feel safe to be vulnerable in that class. And that’s how you have to be receptive to feedback like that, is being bold and vulnerable to make a choice about your communication, and then you have to be resilient to not take the coaching personally. Not a really useful way to go about it, IMO. Just based on your post, it sounds like a place to cultivate fear and not great communication skills. 3) do your best not to take it personally. I hope you can find something to take away from the class. But honestly if people are interested in improving communication skills, I would highly recommend improv.

A lot of my classmates didn't realize the requirements of becoming a veterinarian and got a rude awakening by our professors.

It'll also put you on the clinical side of things and you'll know if you like it or hate it. The first thing I got trained to do as a vet assistant was how to get histories, so it is a fair amount of talking. Some of my classes are really hard. They actually are having me take the same biology classes as all the premed students and it's a lot of information and reading. So it can be stressful. One of my classes is where professors come in from the ADVS department and talk about jobs other than being a veterinarian. The most interesting of all the professors was a professor with a doctorate in beef nutrition. She had gotten accepted into veterinary school but fell in love with research. She runs some really interesting research projects at our school like what poisonous plants do the rumen of a cow. So she encourages to get involved in any research project at the school. Also have a backup plan for if you're not accepted into vet school so you didn't just waste all the time of going through undergrad.

I've been doing a lot of research but I thought I'd ask first hand for some of my questions as it's a little difficult to find in things like articles. I am currently a freshman in highschool and have started animal science as my CTE. I assumed this would be the right path to go since it's focused mainly around veterinary practice. I live on a ranch with my family, which is mainly what aspired me to want to go into the veterinary feild; that and my compassion for animals in general.1. My main struggle is college as I can't find any clear answers on how that works. It seems that it's all variables which I'm having a hard time comprehending. If someone could clearly explain that in a more step-by-step format it would probably help as most of the articals I read are very long-winded and hard to understand.2. Anytime I try reading about the process of entering the veterinary feild it's almost discouraging as everything ends with 'It's not worth it'. All I hear about it how terrible the student loan debt is and that most vets live miserably. Is it not worth it to enter the veterinary feild?3. Just how rough are the student loans and is there any way to dampen them even just a bit? I have a job working at one of my local restaurants that pays well enough for a minimum wage job and I plan on saving as much of that as I can for college. 4. Is there a specific course you have to take for large animal veterinary medicine (cows, goats, horses, etc.) or is it also taught alongside small animal veterinary medicine?

I had my son my sophomore year of college and being practically homeless made it really difficult. I worked full time, took care of my son and just tried to barely survive. My end GPA at my undergrad school was 2.89. so I completely understand that low grades can be hard to come back from. I share this because I have gone on to get waitlisted at a vet school and this year I have again gotten interviews and a chance to go. Look at each vet school before you write yourself off and see what their requirements are and how they calculate GPA. I put mine into a Google doc so it was easy to read. I then looked VERY critically at my own academic experience and matched all the classes I had taken and their grades with the prereqs of each school.  A lot of schools (not all) out more weight on last 45 (semester credits, 60 quarter credits) than on overall GPA. If you can show in your last 45-60 credits that you were able to turn your grades around, it makes a really compelling case for you GPA wise. As for the DUI, I would be honest but not overly ""woah is me"" when it comes to discussing it.  They are not robots and the admissions people are generally awesome to talk to. So go into it with a growth mindset. ""I messed up, but here is what I learned and how I am taking steps in the future to keep it from happening again."" Diverse experiences and lots of hours will also help your case. If you look at your experience and see you don't have large animal or research, try to find ways to really get as much variety and length of hours as you can. I work in the research field, so my hours there number over 10k, but I had never worked in private practice, so I called every vet practice I could reasonably get to and found one that let me shadow. If you love wildlife, get involved at a wildlife rehab place and show that you really do want to be in that field, or become a zoo volunteer. Your past is only a fraction of who you are.
