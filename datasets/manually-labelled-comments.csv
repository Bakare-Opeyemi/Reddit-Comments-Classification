I have taken a pretty curvy road to get where I'm applying to vet school this year, so I'm about 10 years post high school where I did about 100 hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics. 

I've called both of them and they said they don't have records that far back for volunteer hours, and it's been almost 10 years so I'm sure the vets don't remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each (full days for a full week at each clinic) 

I'm wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago, and if so, how does the VMCAS  verify clinic hours? Would they call the vet for verification, or need something signed? I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience, I'm just not sure what to expect.

I have taken a pretty curvy road to get where I'm applying to vet school this year, so I'm about 10 years post high school where I did about 100 hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics. 

I've called both of them and they said they don't have records that far back for volunteer hours, and it's been almost 10 years so I'm sure the vets don't remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each (full days for a full week at each clinic) 

I'm wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago, and if so, how does the VMCAS  verify clinic hours? Would they call the vet for verification, or need something signed? I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience, I'm just not sure what to expect.

I recommended a dental with likely extractions for his old small breed dog with Perio 4, and he told me that it’s ridiculous to recommend extractions for teeth with just recession. I told him I’d never even imagine telling my human dentist how to practice medicine, gave him the information for a veterinary dentist in the area, and declined to schedule “just a teeth cleaning”. 

I’d say mostly I don’t have issues with clients in the human medical field though.|I’d be looking for another job ASAP. Talk to your boss, cite specific examples of hostility/abuse.

As of now, you will owe income tax on the amount forgiven. So that’s 25 years of a mortgage payments that will not touch principal (and realize average cost of living makes zero difference on the payment amount) with a huge tax burden at the end.

The benefits are good, the pay is good, and you have more options to move up in administrative positions if you want that kind of thing. There’re a lot of safety nets and backup because it’s corporate. Work place injury, covering for ER overnight because of a rare complication, etc, Banfield makes it fairly straightforward. 

My private practice experience was abysmal in comparison.|Financially, no. 

If you’d asked me two years ago, I’d say hell no in all ways. But I’m in a good spot now. I make pretty good money, I can work extra days easily for good pay, and I’m never ever bored at work. I work with a great, non-toxic team too. The stress is manageable now too. But the first three years were hell; the first year out was all suicide ideation.

How will the MYST token be used in the network?  Recently I read that users of Mysterium will also be able to pay in ETH. Is this correct?

I would like to thank you for setting up this AMA. My congratulations to you and the team, you all have been working very hard over the past years. The application is great and I’m excited for what the future will bring. Keep it up!

I do have some questions, hope you don't mind me asking.  
 

**Team:**  


* Can you tell us something about the team? How many people are currently working at Mysterium?  
 

**Community:**  


* Do you think the community members and backers of Mysterium are important and why?
* How do you think Mysterium can improve to get the community more involved? 

  
**Networking:**  
Mysterium was on the foreground raising awareness in the Ethereum community by building this important piece of tech, a decentralized VPN network. After the fundraising Mysterium went mysteriously quiet. Nowadays, barely anyone from the Ethereum community or the Web3foundation knows about you guys. Which is sad because many of them are located in Berlin where Mysterium is based as well.

I remember Robert visited Devcon a few years ago in Cancun. The other Devcons, ETHBerlin, DAPPcon…. You guys were just not there.  
 

* Is there any particular reason why Mysterium stays absent at major, important events?
* And do you think it should be improved and how?
* Do you think networking is important?

**Tokenomics:**

As far as I know, the decision making about what role MYST tokens have inside Mysterium mainly took place internally in the team. The community was never involved.   


* What different token models did you explore or study?
* How do you think the current model will create value for MYST?
* Will MYST tokens have a governance role in the future?
* Did you explore any staking contract models?   
For example, where every MYST token transaction pays a tiny amount of fee to a staking contract. The one who stakes more is collecting more fees.
* Will Mysterium create a MYST liquidity pool on Uniswap in the future? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/gc3zxw/ama_jaro_šatkevic_head_of_product_9_am_est_5th/fpjlt4h/"

41,ARatNamedClydeBarrow,2,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol).

It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I’m losing one of my new grads and I’m super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn’t have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.|I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER. I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients don’t want to listen.|As a VA, this makes me so sad for you.

Hi, after doing some changes and test, now I'm getting different errors in the logs (and of course, VPN client neither connect).

Updated docker run command:

```bash
docker run --cap-add NET_ADMIN -d -p 7500-7700:7500-7700 -p 4449:4449 --name myst -v /volume2/virtualization/docker/mysterium-node:/var/lib/mysterium-node --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun  mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest service --agreed-terms-and-conditions
```

I have to run wireward in another docker and link to the main docker? I found no information related to this...


I'm running this on a synology, where the port 5000 is used by DSM and seems that tries to use it (i can change it, but why is happening?):

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions. 

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go?|Okay.

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask""

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions. 

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go?|Okay. Thank you|the external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask"" 

Now I am able to see my Myst tokens in metamask.|As long as public is off. You should be fine. The rest, you can leave it on.|No, your node is online and running.

Second, I also want to turn Public on but I have to read and understand very well on ""how to run an exit node"" https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/

This is their original guide on how to run an exit node. 

There are deffinitely  important information in that guide. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/18m7j0n/i_would_like_to_turn_on_public_is_it_safe_to_do/keo75a6/ | How are you able to reach 50-100 MYST with one node? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/18k2l2r/cgnat_to_static_address_worth_the_upgrade/kdpnqf6/ | Hmm. Okay I appreciate the answer. Its been 11 hours and 58 minutes. Only 2.87MB used. That's very interesting. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/183y04w/only_936_kib_in_4_hours/kat7ggf/ | I did a clean pi OS installation and it seems to be working normal right now. Made 5 mysts in the past 4-5 days. 

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions. 

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/183y04w/only_936_kib_in_4_hours/kc0deh6/ | Okay. Thank you ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/183y04w/only_936_kib_in_4_hours/kaubvs6/ | the external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask"" 

Now I am able to see my Myst tokens in metamask. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/183y04w/only_936_kib_in_4_hours/kcg1uya/ | Hello. Can you explain a little bit more please? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u00alh/concerned_about_someone_torrenting_on_your_node/ke2b6lm/ | Hello.

How are you running 3 nodes at home network?

I have 2 Rpi Zero W and 1 Pi 400. I would like to do the same.

Would be appreciated if you can help me with the steps. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/t5svx5/the_world_needs_mysterium_and_mysterium_needs/kanouph/"

U could be connected with upnp which is normal, but I would recommend switching that and manually forward you router firewall rules. (Ports 50000,60000) in this case. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jj2hrah/ | What do you mean its not recognize port interval?

Depending on your router you can specify a port range usually something like 50000-60000 will work but sometimes it uses a ~ or some other. check your model for that info.

Probably not all traffic. But check that on site. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jj2kvpv/ | To my knowledge there is no limit, only thing is the bandwidth limit I guess. 
I never had any more than 4 or 5 simultaneous connections.

so i would say that this is not normal behavior. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vtsdpi/000135/ig55ksg/ | I have docker running windows, and everything works fine. Just go to your local UI. Port 4449 or something. There you can adjust things like the UDP port range to use. And you can open up those ports if UPNP did not already ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/i7wd4b1/ | i changed my UDP ports range to 33000:60000 and open it in the router.

did you solve it by now? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/i9jp9m5/ | Hahaha there he is. Commenting on my other posts.

Now everything is working fine. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/17uzka6/no_traffic_on_my_node/kcdort7/ | UPnP is always on. I have been using it from last year. Even my income was very good. Yesterday I reinstalled the whole thing, paid again to get registered. Still the same. I dont even change anything in my router cause it took way too much time to configure and find proper channels in my area and all. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15fuyq9/new_issue_in_the_node/juipkb4/ | I have found the issue.

90,PresentationFuzzy658,2,Honestly I had a nurse come into our clinic and it was the most annoying incident ever. She made so many complaints and then complained at how she was a nurse who worked night shifts and didn’t have time for whatever “mistake” we made. She basically had a card decline on a monthly payment and was FURIOUS. I left her multiple voicemails that we would eat that payment and rectify things and she never called back. Apparently her job is just so extremely important and she’s too busy to call the clinic back idrc. But yeah they all have some sort of entitlement/god complex. Some guy even claimed to be a neurosurgeon (he was a PA in neurology) my least favorite clients are healthcare workers of stature like Nurse/PA/MD they just love to tell everyone their title. I met some who were really nice those are usually the MD but yeah that’s my two cents that no one asked for 🥲

105,poldertrash,2,"The project and product need a bit more traction if you plan on making a business out of facilitating nodes in CSPs.

The rewards are literally pennies. For me less than 1MYST/mo (combined) while running 10 nodes. And then there's the risk of your connection being misused by malicious actors for fraud or worse.

These nodes, except my node at home, are all cloud-based in various regions of the world and have 1Gbps bandwidth. Occasionally I see a visitor that consumes a few gigs, bot most of the time it's dead quiet. The nodes in US and middle east region are busiest, but only generate less than 0.75MYST/mo combined.

108,xdg07,2,">Are we expected to see a traffic increase for non-whitelisted nodes in the near future?

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).|>Why should I invest in MYST now? What are your plans to drive value to the token?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token. As mentioned above, both our dVPN consumer and B2B client base is growing, meaning that network traffic is increasing as well.  
Additionally, you can stake your MYST token into Delegation pool https://app.iq.space/ (powered by our partners IQ protocol) and earn rewards.|>Is there a specific reason that Mysterium VPN is not listed on the Apple store?

Yes, the main issue was technical iOS requirements for the runtime. Due to decentralised P2P network specifics, our VPN apps has to include the whole node code which makes runtime bigger than allowed.

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).|>Why should I invest in MYST now?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token.

I will say, we did have constant issues with having to stay 1-2+ hours late consistently due to the residents moving slower. I think our tech’s behavior was just from being worn down from the industry and not having the patience to deal with baby vets on the daily. 

TBF, our schedule was always packed and we were chronically over-worked. We also had many residents who refused to listen to experienced techs/assistants in the field, which would just cause more problems. 

But that tech being directly disrespectful is a problem. You are a DVM, if you want to me called Dr., that is absolutely fine and that tech should respect that."

141,iniminimum,2,"This is not meant to come across as rude, but most new doctors come in and are too big tmfor their britches. 


If they are disrespecting you there is probably a reason.


Instead of just bossing the techs around, try talking to them, and work through problems with them.

There is nothing worse than a fresh doctor who comes in and starts bossing techs around without learning the flow ofnthe hospital.

I've been a cvt for 13 years in ecc/icu and oncology , and have worked with many intern docs, and have worked with many who think they know everything/they know best, and those doctors tend to get the cold shoulder .


Just food for thought"

155,spaghetti000s,1,"Steps to becoming a Radiologist:

Vet school:
x. Be within the top 1/3 of your class in Vet school (4 years)
x. Try and get published while in vet school (even just a case report is incredibly helpful)
x. Get to know your radiology department in vet school; if at all possible try to get a student worker position in the department. Ask questions, don't be annoying, read Thrall textbook as often as you can

Post Vet School:
x. Rotating internship first, choose one that has at least 2 board certified radiologists (need at least two letters of rec from them)
x. if you didn't get published in vet school, you need to do it during the rotating internship
x. Read Thrall on your downtime

Post Rotating Internship:
x. Apply for both specialty radiology imaging internships (1yr) and residencies (3-4yrs) in the same Match cycle; if you don't match to a residency first try (quite rare), hopefully you'll match to an imaging internship. Get published during this internship if you did not in the previous two steps. Read the entirety of Thrall during this internship.

x. Many many people get stuck after rotating and are unable to secure a residency position; its very competitive. It's a mix of good preparation (high GPA, good letters of rec, publications), personality (gotta get along with people for three years in residency so they won't choose an asshole no matter how brilliant you are), and connections (see step 1, getting to know the radiology department at your vet school). Above all, a healthy does of luck.


Why do all of this? Radiology is AWESOME. Most interesting specialty by far, radiologists are the hub of the hospital and get to discuss every interesting case with the top specialists in the hospital. NO owner communication - never get yelled at or make another estimate ever again. Work life balance - arguably the best you'll ever have in this field, you can work from home 100% of the time if you want to, but also amazing flexibility (can work part time from home, part in specialty hospital for example, or go do ultrasounds in local clinics one day a week). Money - you'll be nice and comfy. 

If you have the financial means and the time to put your head down and grind through the internships to get a residency... I say give it a shot. Hit me up with questions if you have them!|Most of the doctors working at vet schools have to also be doing research in addition to their clinical and teaching duties. A lot of them will be willing to let students work in their lab and help with their current projects so that’s a way to get your name on something. Also going to the specialty you’re interested in (radiology in my case) and asking if any of them would be interested in mentoring you and helping you write a case report (way shorter and easier to do than a full research study). Essentially you have to find a “grown up” lol to help you get started.

Edit to add - you should’ve been assigned an advisor when you started vet school. They can probably help you find a project to jump on||Most of the doctors working at vet schools have to also be doing research in addition to their clinical and teaching duties.

Take this response to heart OP, it’s a good one. 

I kept my head down and made it through my internship and it sucked and I felt almost worse for having done it… but I’m in my residency now in the specialty I love and I’m having a great time. Internship in some cases can just be a hoop to jump through or means to an end. No matter what you choose you aren’t wrong OP. You’re in probably the toughest year of your career right now."

It might not be on the test you're taking, if it's some guy from Ohio's material, but if you're confused about a concept, someone's probably written it in a better way.

To disconnect you need to do a DELETE call on [http://localhost:4050/connection](http://localhost:4050/connection)

Now your virtual machine has a new network interface called myst.

You can now configure a proxy server in your container to use the myst interface

Here it is the configuration using squid:

    logfile_rotate 0
    http_access allow localnet
    cache deny all
    tcp_outgoing_address 0.0.0.0 all
    dns_nameservers 1.1.1.1
    dns_v4_first on

Now you can use the new server as a proxy connected to the myst network.

I think you can do this in docker too|You can do this by creating multiple container of myst nodes and connect them to the network

Here is a simple python script to use the API to connect to another myst node:

    import requests as r
    import json import os
    url=""http://localhost:4050/""
    providers=r.get(url+""proposals"").json()
    proposals=providers[""proposals""]
    print(proposals[0])
    provider_id=proposals[0][""provider_id""]
    consumer_id=""your consumer id""
    print(provider_id)
    os.system(f""myst cli connect {consumer_id} {provider_id} wireguard dns=system"")

168,Popular_Hour6343,1,"I didn't know. Someone randomly mentioned vet school in convo and I never considered it until then (after 1st year of undergrad). I decided to job shadow that summer (4 months) and get a feel for it. Looking back, I wasn't really exposed to a whole lot but generally I enjoyed my time job shadowing. 

I pursued vet school, got in, started, and thats where i really started to ask myself if this is what I want to do. I started to wonder if I can actually do this, if I'm cut out for it, if I'm actually going to be able to enjoy it, because its one thing to watch a vet work, but a whole other thing to be the vet working. 

Anyways, I just went with the flow of things hoping that I can do it and I would enjoy it, and when i got to my clinical year, that's when I knew. A big part of the doubt was having confidence to do the things that vets do, and basically the more exposure and practice I got, the more my confidence built and the more I was able to enjoy the work.|No you're not, I'm from Canada and went to Melbourne for vet school, my grades weren't good enough for the schools in Canada and the states. It's not selling yourself short, it's just being realistic about your opportunities for success. Look at Australia, not sure how tuition compares to island schools, but with the conversion it was cheaper than the states. Check out oztrekk.|Recently graduated from unimelb, most of my classmates (the ones that shared their salaries) earn between 70-85k. One of my friends found a job in Sydney at a private clinic (smallies) offering 100k. Don't sell yourself short. If I were still there I wouldn't accept an offer less than 90. Ideally 100+.|Yeah fair point. Whichever clinic I chose would depend on salary, support, mentorship, hours, distance, and etc. If all the other factors are ideal, I wouldn't mind a lower salary, but depends how low. Disposable income is really important to me, especially around this range. The minimum I'd expect is mainly for me to live some what comfortably. So honestly I'd try to find another offer if it was <90k regardless of the other factors. And yeah there is pressure to produce, but even at 100k, you should be able to produce 5x times that if it's a well managed clinic, especially if you're keen to do surgeries and dentals.|I'm a new grad from Canada, about to write my navle soon, but tbh I don't even look at jobs that don't post a salary, if I get desperate then maybe.|I job shadowed for the first time when I was 19 and I didn't take any notes. Now 27, I don't remember anything from my job shadowing experience except for the overall feelings of the experience (which I think should be the focus so early in your schooling)

If you're consistently involved with a vet through the years, you'll naturally learn a lot through repetition without having to write anything down. 

You still have the rest of high-school, 4 years of undergrad, and then 4 years of vet school, I wouldn't bother taking any notes now, I think most vets would understand that. That being said, take a note pad and if you're interested in something, make a note and look it up at home. Have fun job-shadowing!|I didn't know.

It is possible that my node will become more popular as people realize my node is not going to be blocked by anyone (my ISP is a total joke) and it has fairly high bandwidth (500Mbit/sec).  I feel confident in opening my node for any activity because I have a firewall between my node and my internal network, so I hope my earnings will increase, but it is all about how much your node is used.  
If you already have the infrastructure (I didn't pay extra for my bandwidth, I already have fiber) it is a nice, small way to get into crypto, but certainly not a huge money maker.

198,WarrenTheWarren,2,"So, just to be clear, you want to route all of your home's outgoing traffic through a Myst node for anonymity  reasons?

Edit: The reason doesn't really matter. I just want to make sure I understand which direction the traffic is going. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5bhixa/ | OK, so the short answer is I think you can run a myst node and pi hole on the same computer, although I doubt you will what you really want out of it.

Pi hole blocks ads by acting as a DNS server. When you want to go to [google.com](https://google.com) or something, the first thing your browser does is ask your DNS server to figure out the numerical IP address of that website. In the case of pi hole, it keeps a list of ad websites so when your browser asks for one of those sites, pi hole returns an IP address that basically points to nothing.

A VPN server acts as an entry point to a network from the outside world. In this case, your myst node is acting as a VPN server that takes a connection in, and sends it right back out again. That way someone else's traffic looks like it's coming from your house. So connecting to your own myst node will just make YOUR traffic look like its coming from YOUR house (which it probably is). So in that way you are just spinning your wheels.

So the pi hole and myst functions are really different, and could probably be run on the same machine because they are doing different things. Now what you could (probably) do is run the Mysterium VPN client on the pi hole machine and try to get your household traffic to be routed through that client. BUT you would be using that client to connect to someone else's node, not your own. And that means you are paying MYST for all of your traffic, which is probably not ideal.

I hope that makes sense.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I was assuming that your pi-hole/myst setup would be at your home. If you are hosting them somewhere else, then I guess it would make sense to connect to your own myst node... but still don't do that. You will end up paying more MYST than its worth. It would be better to just run openVPN or something on that server for free. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5bmc8s/ | Depending on the use case it might even make sense to set up a SOCKS proxy rather than a full VPN. No extra software is required, just a modified SSH command (ssh -D PORT HOST) and then telling your computer to connect via the specified port number. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5cgut8/ | Yeah, running the myst node wont hurt anything, but it's not what you would want to do for your personal VPN. So run it if you want to earn MYST, not if you want a VPN. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5cgaeh/ | Because a myst node is more like a traffic relay rather than a secure connection to his home network. Of course he can run a myst node, but if he has full control of the server, he would do better to use openVPN directly for a secure connection or setting up a proxy if he just wants traffic to appear to come from his home.

The benefit of myst really comes in when you want your traffic to come from a source that is completely unrelated to you or your current location. Setting it up so the traffic you generate while at starbucks looks like its coming from your home is really a strange thing to do. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5clpwv/ | It's a bit messier than a nice export button, but you can get a JSON report of your session history by going to this URL:

[`http://[IP_ADDRESS]:[PORT_NUMBER]/tequilapi/sessions?direction=Provided&provider_id=[NODE_ID]&page_size=[`](http://192.168.1.87:4449/tequilapi/sessions?direction=Provided&provider_id=0x988d37ac70a3d987d502e24316799286be4f8729&page_size=100)`SESSIONS_PER_PAGE]&page=[PAGE_NUMBER]`

\[IP\_ADDRESS\] = Your node's IP address

\[PORT\] = The port for your node's web UI

\[NODE\_ID\] = This is a long hex string that can be found as ""Your Identity"" under the settings tab (click the gear).

\[SESSIONS\_PER\_PAGE\] = How long of a list of sessions you want to see.

\[PAGE\_NUMBER\] (Optional) = Which page you results you want to see

You can omit the \[PAGE\_NUMBER\] argument and have your page size be really large so everything is displayed at once. Each session has an ID associated with it so if you keep track of the last session in your exported log, you can just keep increasing the page size until you start seeing repeats.

This will give you a JSON output which is somewhat hard to read, but if you load it in Firefox, it should automatically be formatted for you with section folding. There are also JSON to CSV converters online that will give you something more like what you want to see. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u0m3wi/export_or_savebackup_session_history_of_mystberry/i4d75mf/"

Kinda sad because it has potential but bad teams crush crypto projects all the time.   


FYI if you thought earnings is bad now, when you whitelist traffic its going to get worst GL though! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u90ytp/after_10_days_and_40_gb_im_shutting_down_my/i5q8rge/ | Running a myst node atm only helps the company for its not worth it nor does anything special for your network. Run open vpn & pi hole of you’re focusing on securing your network. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5gpilq/ | Don't let a few lucky persons convince you to how ""good"" this project is... Its not worth it running a node on this project for most of the node runners shut down their nodes because its a waste of time and honestly feels like a scam or they just don't care about node runners. I had 17 nodes running for this project in which I realized its not even worth it and only left a few running now directing my resources to other projects that actually care about growing their project.

For example this is my most profitable node.....

1.00 MYST Total Earnings

1d 12:58:59 Sessions time

20.48 GB Transferred

its a dead project and the team is silent only poping up now and again ..... my advice don't use your residential resources to risk a dmca letter but make a free server and just let it run until this project improves.. otherwise don't listen to moon boys or hopium folks. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42fc8l/ | Bruh lmao it’s toxic and misleading to tell the truth ? You really think residential nodes alone going to build this network out huh? 

You’re sounding more than a crypto doge bro, when lambo boy with your pathetic reply for if you don’t incentivize and keep your community updated you’ll never get serious mode runners 

But shill along my guy because this project is in alpha so stop spreading fake news and actually pay attention to the dead project you’re staning for ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42soxx/ | They removed the free registrations without even telling the community they just did it.  


They also TAX node runners 20% of their earnings every time they withdraw   


Their tokenomics favors a few and not all  


Their should not be 1 type of node runner being favored over another, also a simple weekly update video goes a long way for persons who actually believe in the project will have issues in which we hear nothing except with stupid updates that means nothing to us like a. sudo dao... like bro literally when that was announced half of the node runners left..   


We complain because we care but removing someone post because it serves a different opinion shows how corporate this project is and it smells stink of centralization taking advantage of the decentralization community.. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i42i08q/ | A bigger network is a more valuable network, a more reliable network and simply a better network. If this project needs to grow to the point to compete with the Nord vpns of the world, you need to incentivize node runners, have a better marketing plan and be more transparent with the community.  Having a moon boy mentality without substance will only be the end of just another project... kinda sad tbh because this project has so much potential.. for example.. they're pushing their fkin stickers creation for telegram.... stickers.. like out of all the complaints the community has their ways is to market is a sticker competition... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ts51dt/are_node_runnersusers_happy_with_the_recent_major/i3earqk/ | Man it kinda sucks cause this project has potential, I hope this thread reaches someone in their team also I hope more node runners comment on this thread so that it can receive the attention it needs because it looks like the feeling is very mutual in the community. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1gos6d/ | I agree fully, the lack of transparency is concerning af...... I've talked to may node runners and all said they're giving it some months again before unplugging because its not profitable and they don't feel part of the team incentives is the reality they have to fix if they want node runners to stay on this project, unless they don't really care about node runners and they're doing their own enterprise servers then feeding participation crumbs to node runners  but I can be very wrong for its just the feed back im getting atm and seeing for myself. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1gcxzu/ | As u/mrk-w said the FAQ has't been updated, also there is no official post from them stating the residential nodes gain more than datacenter nodes this is just a assumption by the community. How do you know that marketing is targeted in specific regions have you seen it or is it something that was said by the team (not being rude its a genuine question).  


The lack of transparency especially with the 20% cut and how its being used is crazy shady when you're not seeing the growth or progress. Its not like nodes can withdraw myst anyways atm for some folks but getting a response on why is begging the team for a response or a update on these things.   


Lets hope they do see these posts because the community of node runners especially is not happy. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1iv4gm/ | Yea I saw it has a data issue which they eventually fixed because people complained…… sheesh that long your node is with them ? Man that’s rough… it really does feel like node runners are not benefiting from this or they don’t care about us. I really hope that’s not the case for it will suck to know that myst is just another cash grab to take advantage of the crypto community ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1nqd0z/"

I would see what IP is linked when you mouse over the Node UI button on the mystnodes website, and then make sure that your router gives that new address appropriate permissions. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137c4yg/lost_access_to_ui/jix5ugj/ | It depends on your hardware, but even a Raspberry Pi 3 is capable of handling a Storj node, as well as bandwidth-sharing apps that can all earn passive income for you like a Myst node does.  


Here are all the bandwidth-sharing apps I have running simultaneously on a Pi or in Docker. In both formats, I've confirmed they work with Pis. These are referral links, but some will give you bonuses that the regular sign-up does not.  


Honeygain ($5 sign-up bonus): https://r.honeygain.me/FEUERD3855

Finally, there's Storj. You will need a large hard drive, like at least 2 terabytes, to make anything substantial, but essentially you're renting your drives and getting paid to help host a decentralized cloud storage service. More info on that here, which should include a Pi setup guide: https://www.storj.io/node ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jddebhk/ | Glad to help and thank you too! If I remember right on Honeygain, Pawns and Bitping, I did something special to each that's a little different from their Pi instructions.

-Pawns works on Pi specifically by having Docker installed on it (they have an ARM variant of the container) I'd have to check what I changed on the Docker command, but I made it start detached I think.

-Bitping doesn't need Docker, but since I was doing it on a headless Pi, I installed Screen first, then started a new Screen session via SSH before executing the command to start the Bitping node. This lets you disconnect while it keeps running.

-Honeygain will work on Pis if you run it with an Android image on an SD card. Install Vysor and you can remote access it, allowing you to run headless and still see the Android GUI.

-EarnApp is a one time setup and doesn't need any additional work. It can run simultaneously alongside the others or Docker!

If I had to guess regarding your previous storage node, it might have been Filecoin? That was the similar project I knew about at least.

Also, all of these projects also have Windows, Linux and regular Docker variants if that's more your thing! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdgbqoc/ | Weird that there might have been another storage project like these two, but you're probably right that it's gone by now.  


I didn't include Filecoin because personally, I haven't tried it myself to confirm whether it's a project where you'll ever see a return like the others. It's definitely a legitimate project, but it has much higher barriers to entry than Storj does for node contributors. Filecoin's [node setup site](https://sp.filecoin.io/) says that you're required to provide a minimum of 10 terabytes, while Storj will let you start with as little as 500 gigs.  


Another one that I forgot was Chia, but it's not a cloud storage project like the other two. This one also requires huge storage drives, but rather than renting them out, Chia uses them as ""plots,"" which I think is their version of mining. It can apparently be destructive to drives and I couldn't even get it working when I tried it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdskgy6/ | There is a Raspberry Pi 3 clone (actually slightly more powerful than it, somewhere in between a 3 and a 4) called Le Potato. It mirrors the Rpi 3 schematic, so you can use Pi cases on it or put it in a Pi cluster rack, and I think it supports similar variants of Linux.

They're selling on Amazon for $30 for 1 gig of RAM, or $35 for 2 gigs. https://amzn.to/3yIZAF3 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11s0em8/aside_from_an_rpi_what_other_cheaper_sbcs_would/jcfrf3x/ | I don't really see much of a point to putting a large SD card in if the Pi or Le Potato is only running Myst. Something like a 16 gig or 32 gig will work fine, and may even be snappier. Sandisk Extremes have a great speed and their 32g model is only $10 on Amazon: https://amzn.to/408Anj2 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11s0em8/aside_from_an_rpi_what_other_cheaper_sbcs_would/jcfrww8/"

I think the problem isn't entrance to making a node being difficult, I believe the problem is usage. There's just not many people using the vpn. So there's not necessarily a lot of demand for bandwith. 

Now...if OP could figure out a way to advertise, and get more people to use the VPN, that would help all of us out.

Running Myst through another VPN is retarded and generates basically no reward because it gives you a hosted IP.

It's not CPU intensive though.|I have tried running a Myst node across another VPN and can confirm it's not worth it. They detect it as coming from a database IP and thus hardly anyone uses it because most of the people using the network want a residential IP to get around geolocked things which are also able to detect a database IP and thus block you for using a VPN.

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything.

Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!|Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up.

Hey guys, I am an alumni from the University of Florida in Gainesville and didn’t get into vet school last VMCAS cycle. I’m currently doing research on vet schools outside of the United States, but I’m trying to find the best ways to stay involved in Vet-Med since I’m no longer in Gainesville and don't have access to resources like a pre-veterinary club.

Any tips on what else I can do in the meantime? I currently work at a small-animal clinic."

Edit: I’ve made about .003 Myst, and about $8.60 in HNT, and the rest with Monero.

Myst has been running the longest and I’m thinking about abandoning that project. Monero I just started about 36 hours ago - that one seems to have the best chance so far. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1eoy9u/ | I should mention that Monero mining does not use or allow GPU gear. So no need to have expense; impossible to obtain, equipment either. The real trick is to get into a mining pool - where the rewards are shared. Network Chuck (YT) had a great video on how to do this stuff (esp with Monero). The other guy to check out is “Your Friend Andy” on YT. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1ev6n7/ | Time will tell. I think the Helium ride is over - I’ve only been up and running for about two weeks, but I’ve watched the earnings steadily drip lower. Since I have the miner installed, I’ll leave it run until I get my hardware investment back at least. Too early to tell yet, but I’m hopeful on the Monero “farm”. I started running it on a Raspberry Pi 4 B (2 GB) and it barely works. I then did an install on my Linux box and that one is cracking hashes nicely. The Windows machine is doing ok. I do have another raspberry pie coming tomorrow (this one with 8 GB memory, so we’ll see how it goes there.

If I would mine with my CPU it would hash about 10kh/s and pc eats like 150w, that would make me about 9€/30days, cost of running that for 30 days with 0,12€/kwh would be about 13€, so I would lose money. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i22u5cv/"

You would be exactly average, lol.|That's literally all that our intake interview was about: difficult ethical choices. Sometimes, there is no good choice. I highly recommend you read up on ethics in veterinary medicine before pursuing a career in it.|Well, as they say, you can lead a horse to water...|Lots of great responses here.

I'll add my story. The day I decided to become a vet was after dinner at my parents. I was 25, nearing the end of my masters and the next step would have been a PhD but I didn't want that. As I was leaving, a thought struck me:

I'm going to apply to vet med. 

And that's what I did. It wasn't some life long desire. It was a whim. A passing thought. That took root and grew like a weed. I liked medicine. That's what I wanted to do. So I did it and it worked out.

It doesn't have to be a big dream! It can be exactly what you want right now. For the record I very much disliked vet school and live clinical practice.|Absolutely! I love it. ❤️

Euthanasia is an essential service and probably most important aspect of my job. I actually like that we can relieve suffering this way in animal medicine.

Vet med will always be there. Spending time with baby and being there for her is my priority now. Work is second. I love being a vet but it has changed my outlook. Life is so much more now.

what site should I use to swap matic for myst? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/s32gat/riskfree_staking_earning_launching_mysterium/hsia3ku/ | Going through the steps and I am having trouble with quickswap. I see articles that say MYST is on there, but clicking those urls sends me to quickswap with an error. In quickswap if I search for MYST it doesnt come up.

I should note that obviously I was able to swap MATIC for MYST to get my node running, but doing so gave me that warning ""any one can create a token"". 

&#x200B;

What am I missing? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rezkjb/how_to_withdraw_reasonably/hpxcme9/ | Sorry Mike, I meant I was able to go from matic to myst with the warning, but trying to go from myst to matic, the myst token isnt on quickswap. 

If I follow the link from the mysterium article that says its now on quickswap, I get ""ipfs resolve -r /ipns/info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x7E2eaA9514C7A56b4D556ff0D1009Cb9C7F2B89D: no link named ""pair"" under QmXfSJfcwmvJEfjrG817Vd7hj8FGC4FPUEeNLokyyYm1tb"" ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rezkjb/how_to_withdraw_reasonably/hpxjf0e/ | Ok, I think I fixed it. If you go to [quickswap.exchange](https://quickswap.exchange), click on token, and paste the myst token contract (0x1379e8886a944d2d9d440b3d88df536aea08d9f3) which is found in the guide to setting up metamask, you can add it. Then while my metamask wallet is connected it sees my coins and gives me the option to swap it for matic. 

I did some searches on the pair value that is in the quickswap error and I saw successful transactions, but they were like 17 days ago. so dont know if quickswap is having a problem in recognizing it, but it looks like it will work with the above steps.

figured I would share it for someone who finds this thread in the future.

302,G000dawgs,1,"I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for. I’m still working in private practice but hope I can help somewhat. 

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself. And if you haven’t heard of [NOMV](https://www.nomv.org) check their site out. 

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase. 

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later. If your clinic uses ANTECH/IDEXX, call and talk to the Internal Medicine specialists at the lab to help you with the bloodwork you submitted. 

I hope you find something that works for you!!!! Good luck!!|I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for. I’m still working in private practice but hope I can help somewhat.

I hope you find something that works for you!!!! Good luck!!|I seriously question your intelligence if you think not accepting $55k in today’s economy is due to a poor work ethic. The cost of living went up and so did the salaries that were offered to keep a vet at your practice. $55k is no longer enough to provide for the living expenses for most vets, especially those with student loans or living in HCOL areas. For $55k, I would rather take on a lower stress 9-5 job that didn’t require all the work and tuition costs to become a vet. I have a fantastic work ethic, and have an advanced degree in a field that is hard to get into. I believe vets should make way more than we do. Do physicians have poor work ethic too because they demand way higher pay than vets?|I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for.

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself.

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase.

I hope you find something that works for you!!!! Good luck!!|I seriously question your intelligence if you think not accepting $55k in today’s economy is due to a poor work ethic. The cost of living went up and so did the salaries that were offered to keep a vet at your practice. $55k is no longer enough to provide for the living expenses for most vets, especially those with student loans or living in HCOL areas. For $55k, I would rather take on a lower stress 9-5 job that didn’t require all the work and tuition costs to become a vet. I have a fantastic work ethic, and have an advanced degree in a field that is hard to get into. I believe vets should make way more than we do.

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later. If your clinic uses ANTECH/IDEXX, call and talk to the Internal Medicine specialists at the lab to help you with the bloodwork you submitted. 

I hope you find something that works for you!!!! Good luck!!|I seriously question your intelligence if you think not accepting $55k in today’s economy is due to a poor work ethic. The cost of living went up and so did the salaries that were offered to keep a vet at your practice. $55k is no longer enough to provide for the living expenses for most vets, especially those with student loans or living in HCOL areas. For $55k, I would rather take on a lower stress 9-5 job that didn’t require all the work and tuition costs to become a vet. I have a fantastic work ethic, and have an advanced degree in a field that is hard to get into. I believe vets should make way more than we do. Do physicians have poor work ethic too because they demand way higher pay than vets?"

308,thenoobient,2,"Hi, thanks for the responses. Let me answer, too.

Ports: like I mentioned, there's no documentation whatsoever. I don't really understand how you consider those ""strong points"". Port 4449 is not once explained. I can obviously figure out it's the web UI port since somewhere on the site it instructs me to open http://ip:4449, but that's it, it's just some implicit information. Regarding those ""UDP ports"", there's also zero explanation, just that ""you should open them"". What range? No info. What are they for? No info. And the rest of those ports that the Myst daemon listens on, again, zero docs. How is that a strong point? And how do I verify my node is working? Because that ""Test"" function on the website definitely doesn't help much...

Firewall: I think here might be some misunderstanding. I'm not talking about my router's firewall, I'm talking about the firewall of the OS that runs Myst. The server itself runs in the cloud at a VPS provider. There's no ""UPnP"" involved as there's no NAT either. There's only firewalld, which won't open ports on its own. And I can't really accept the ""this is for home users"" argument, as the Onboarding page clearly has a dedicated section for _data centers_. And obviously I've been talking about that very scenario.

Purchase: I know the purchase itself is on a separate site, **but** that site is redirecting to your unsecured instance upon completion. Which, again, due to lack of domain name or HTTPS, is completely unreliable. Also what I mentioned, it couldn't even credit my purchase due to some random (undocumented) port not being open. It only credited my MYST the moment I disabled the firewall. Till then, it showed ""0.00000 MYST"" or something. I really don't think managing payments and credit cards should be done via your freshly installed Myst node.

Deb: again, if the project (also) aims for the data center, this argument isn't really valid. Either support the data center, or don't :) And yes, I know, I can run Docker in an EL VM, and map ports, and mount volumes to make a non-persistent construct somewhat persistent, I just fail to see the point. Building an RPM is not harder than building a DEB. Been there, done that :) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/hzzgp3a/ | Uh, don't wanna sound rude, but WireGuard uses whatever port you tell it to use. In fact, as per recently, there wasn't even a default port, just pick whatever you want. Yes, I've been deploying WireGuard servers on my own, in fact, I even developed management scripts and Ansible playbooks for it.

On top of that, Mysterium is more than just a WireGuard server with a different name, so the WireGuard docs will most certainly not tell me what Myst is doing on ports 1900, 5353, 11253, 5353, 4050, 4449, and 36317. These are NOT documented in your docs, period. This is the 3rd time in this post I've been told it's well documented, but I can only repeat myself: it's not well documented, it's nod even badly documented, it's just not documented _at all_. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i08769o/ | I'm sorry, but apparently you don't know how online CC payments work. When you make a credit card purchase, the payment processor **does** send back data to the merchant. How else would the merchant know if the payment was successful or not? The payment processor will most definitely **not** top up your crypto balances or whatnot, they charge your card with the amount specified by the merchant, tell the merchant if the charge was successful or not, and then it's up to the merchant to do whatever they want that info.

But FYI, the story has developed since then, I updated the post. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i087uw3/"

I launched the free registration days ago, without result. But yesterday, I got my first ""guests"" and the *no contract* disappeared from logs.

Not everything is clear, I have the ""*notConnected""* status with CLI ""*myst connection info"".* As web Myst interface is seeing my node online, I guess this command isn't relevant. Or maybe it's connected only when a guest is connected.

Our job as a vet is to prevent suffering and that includes advising owners when it’s time to euthanize a pet that is suffering and has no chance of recovery. Contrary to popular belief the majority of animals (including humans) don’t have peaceful deaths.|Never lie to a child about death. You don’t have to be detailed about it, but it’s unfair to them to lie. I always ask them if they understand what is happening and why, as well as if they have any questions. I tell them what I’m doing and why. Children are not stupid and are usually very perceptive in situations like this. Lying to them sets up unreal expectations later in life (like all animals die in their sleep, ect). When parents ask what they should tell their kids, I tell them that to say something like “spot is very sick and it’s time to let Spot go to heaven so she doesn’t have to hurt anymore, but Spot will be in our hearts for our whole life-we will carry her memory with us always”.|No. They are interviewing others and deciding who they’ll hire. They will call you next week with an answer|As a vet of 18 years-sometimes that thing is hard to find|Yes. But some days it’d be nice to be a Starbucks barista. lol

I get paid well, take vacations 4x per year, my work family is great. My clients are overall fantastic. Many of my closest friends started as clients. And I’m at that age where I (and my boss) have no issue telling asshole clients to kick rocks. 🤷🏼‍♀️.|No. I had a great time in vet school|Nope . Me and the other two vets at my clinic are constantly busy-10 hour day with no lunch busy. And have been consistently for years|We live in the south-opening day of hunting season (deer) is practically a holiday. Almost everyone at my clinic hunts-deer, turkey, hogs.|Circumferential them mod millers or transfix-I call it my sleeper knot-so I can sleep at night and not worry. At least when I did spays…|Midline, USA|Imagine being blackmailed (sued) bc your patient had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic. Cause that’s me right now. Very frustrating|It sounds like you’re getting shuffled around to fill empty spots/staffing shortages|I’ve got full sleeves AND give out my artists card to clients all the time. I’m in a semi rural conservative area|I’ve been a vet 17 years and never had a scrotal hematoma-I close the SQ with pds starting deep then mid then pick a piece of tissue midline (thin superficial tissue over penis ) and the deep mid and superficial on other side. Repeat in continuous way then close securely and do intradermal. I was taught this by Dr. Gary Ellison and have yet to have a problem-looks beautiful and is compressive in nature-no room for blood to collect. This is how I teach all my baby vets to close neuters|No. I had a great time in vet school|Nope . Me and the other two vets at my clinic are constantly busy-10 hour day with no lunch busy. And have been consistently for years|Yes. I have 2-3 days off a week and every other weekend. I hike, forage, go on car trips with our car club, knit and get tattooed regularly.|You could also consider investment finance in the veterinary industry. Lots of opportunities there. Look up Fritz Woods|You’re never going to learn and improve if you don’t put the work in-and this means spending time on your day off learning. I’ve been out 17 years and STILL jump at an opportunity to shadow my boss (of 17 years). And he does the same with me.|Sure. But in the real world splenectomies, fractures and foreign objects don’t come in on your schedule. Don’t complain that you haven’t done one of those procedures then decline an opportunity to do one or assist in one. 
I have a similar situation with an individual I mentor-she complains she wishes that she had more skills and experience. However she either makes an excuse last minute to not come in or completely ghosts me when I offer her opportunities to do so….and i stopped asking her to come along/observe. I’m not putting time into a person if they are not willing to put time into themselves. Growth takes work and commitment. OP by all means tell your boss no when he offers to help you and teach (bc that is what he is doing)  but also expect him to also put less into your relationship|It may also be time to find a new boss|I’ve been a vet for 18 years-have yet to do a convenience euthanasia🤷🏼‍♀️|That’s not what they’re sayings-this myth comes from individuals who have NEVER suffered or watched a loved one suffer, then die a slow painful death from cancer.

I don't recommend myst anymore at all. I got a letter from a lawyer represented by Warner Brothers in my mailbox. They claimed, that I watched the movie Barbie via torrent.
I swear by god me or my wife didn't do that. I had active public mode for my myst node but after I had to pay around 930 Euro because of that shit I shut down the node and deleted everything. After some calls with the lawyers I had to pay the half of the money because it wasn't somebody from our household but the fact that I'm responsible for my internet connection and it will be recorded by a company opened my eyes. 

The lawyer is a legit one, I found a lot of legit stuff about this lawyer. The only addresses that I saw is only location.mysterium.com and something likely like that. If you wanna know more URLs I'll check it for you. I save my own queries for 6 month.

I stopped every bandwidth sharing after that case. I can be happy to life in Germany. To watch illegal shit via torrent is very cheap in Germany in comparison with other countries.|Thank you for the link. Maybe I was to stupid to read that important detail.

359,vairetz,2,"You made a lot of good points but I have something to argue with.

For HTTPS on admin page you're absolutely right. Nothing to say, we need it and it's not negligible.

About firewall and port however I think the Mysterium docs are pretty well done. MisteriumVPN is based on Wireguard, if you want more information about which port does what you can check Wireguard docs. Give it a try. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i014v25/ | I don't know about your bank payments but maybe the payments are not accounted and will be refounded.

However every day at 11 am (Greenwich time) you can use free registration method for your nodes. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/t1efbc/issue_registering_a_node/hyfzir7/ | I don't think but ai always use the free one. Maybe someone else have an idea ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/t1efbc/issue_registering_a_node/hyhwfpe/ | The node store identites file in /var/lib/mysterium-node if you haven't change the directory but I don't know if you can recover the identity without a proper backup. Maybe if you can recover the files you can try a simply copy-paste in a new installation key folder and see if your node can read the old information. 
Not sure about the method.

Next time backup your identities in a .json file to be safe.

Hope you can find a solution. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swltpc/i_fked_up/hxmxd98/"

After a few warnings they can even cut your internet off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iq90vst/ | I am 100% certain. It is called the law HAPODI. As a private person, you are responsible to make sure that no one uses your internet connection to download copyrighted materials. After being warned, they can fine you 7500 euros and then cut off your internet connection.

Also, most european countries have similar laws. Up until a few years ago, they weren't really enforced, but based on stories from my friends in several european countries, the enforcement is starting to become more strict. The general rule is: The more corrupt the country, the less likely they will come after you.

(Also, what is that link that you posted?) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iqc61ys/ | You are wrong (I live in France, and can read the texts in french, also, your link doesn't link to anything).   


1. HAPODI was subsumed into ARCOM in Jan. 2022: It did not go away. They just added an extra layer of bureaucracy, which is what the french love doing.
2. Second, you can check the [french wikipedia site](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_Autorit%C3%A9_pour_la_diffusion_des_%C5%93uvres_et_la_protection_des_droits_sur_internet) to see how often HAPODI is enforced.
3. You can go to the ARCOM web site. The easiest is to go to the [FAQ](https://www.arcom.fr/faq#collapseQR1582), and you will see sections describing why you got a letter from them, the next steps, your responsibilities, the fines, etc.
4. Lastly, I can tell you that I got a letter a few years ago from them for illegally downloading movie over bittorrent. I don't download much, and also was using encrypted torrents at the time (which only protects you from your ISP snooping on you), so the government agency (or content creators) are just entrapping anyone on the bittorrent network who has an ip address in france. They tell you, in essence, to stop and that if it happens again in 6 months they will escalate. 

Now, it is not as bad as it sounds. I believe that after 6 months, all your previous infractions are removed (to verify, I am basing this on my memory). Also, there are so many steps involved that it would probably take 20 years to cut off your internet if you were a repeat offender. You will have to pay the fines though. The first thing that everyone does when they get a letter from HAPODI (pre 2022) or ARCOM (after 2022) is that you sign up for a cheap VPN.

The problem is that if you are running a Mysterium node with ""Public traffic"" activated, you will certainly get caught, and the french law says that you are responsible for everything that happens with your internet connection, even if if was a guest that was visiting. I suspect that most french mysterium nodes are only using B2B traffic because they already know this. I also know that the amount of traffic in general is pretty low in France, so the number of people torrenting on a french Mysterium node is probably small. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iqckx2c/ | I am noticing the same traffic on my pihole as well. I am running my node in whitelisted node, so my assumption is that this is not streaming, but rather part of their web-scraping business. I too don't know why they are using my DNS to do this, as I am blocking some of their requests! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wdfxzx/strange_amazon_dns_queries_from_mystnode/ij3rdos/ | I'd be curious if people in Russia are having problems using the mysterium dVPN as well. Does anyone have any info on that? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ujgbt5/censorship_in_china/i7j5izw/ | I support the long term objectives of Mysterium, and I don't even care if I am making money or not by running a node. Someone asked what types of rewards people are getting with a residential node, and I responded honestly. Is that a reason to remove the post??? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3i86g0/ | Here is my original post

>I am making <0.5 MYST per month on a node in Croatia. (whitelisted, fiber line).  I am losing money with this node and will soon be deactivating it.

I was then asked how I could be losing money as it is ""free"" to run a node that simply generates ""passive income"", to which I responded

>I am loosing money on this node because. There is a sunk cost of buying hardware that will never be paid back (even if an RP4 is cheap!). You need to pay for the electricity. Time is money: you need to devote a little time to keep you node running, updating if from time to time, and keeping informed what the devs are doing. This is time that could be spent doing better things that actually make money.
> Note: Profitability is lower if you run a whitelisted node. Also, some regions of the world get more traffic than other places, and some people are in fact quite profitable. It is my impression that the europe in general has little real traffic.

Now that you have the facts, you can draw your own conclusions. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3liluf/ | This is not moderator ""mistake"". It is a deliberate attempt to make Mysterium Network look good, and to hide anything that does not fit their hopium narrative. Just look at the official twitter feed and you will find the same hopium/pump-n-dump mentality. I speculate that their motives are to increase the number of users and to hype the MYST token (this is the only opinion of mine in this thread, so I am insulted that the mods slapped an ""opinion"" banner on this.). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3lxtfd/ | You are just as secure as you are on your home network. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2u1wzl/ | I think that you are asking a couple different questions:

1. Is the announcement good news? YES
2. Is the announcement ""MAJOR NEWS""? NO
3. Does the announcement solve the problems concerning leadership and transparency of the Mysterium VPN project? NO

Mysterium dVPN has the same problems as many other open source projects. In particular, 

* There is no clear leadership. It is not clear who to contact concerning problems, suggestions, etc. It is not even clear how the team pays for their salaries (is this volunteer? Do they use the 20% setttlement fee? Are the VC investments? If I make a PR, will they pay me?).
* The team as a whole does not value transparency, or does not understand what kind of transparency is required for this kind of project: Simply creating a vague ""roadmap"" diagram with no verbal description is useless.
* The team pays people to promote the project on twitter and to offer support on discord. However, these people are not close enough to the leadership team to answer many questions that people have. Instead of saying ""I don't know"" or ""I'll ask"", they instead try to spin an answer that looks as favorable as possible. Oftentimes, it takes about 10 times to find out that they either don't know or don't know what they are talking about.
* Many questions that the community has gets answered ""informally"" via chat, twitter, reddit, and are never answered in a formal way (such as on their web site, FAQ, etc). This makes it impossible for newcomers to find all the information that they need.
* When the community starts to voice frustration, the leadership simply ignores the underlying complains (""This is open source, why are they complaining?"").
* And lastly, if the project is open source, it is also a business (they take a 20% settlement fee). Because of this, the leadership doesn't feel like they need to explain the ""business decisions"" that affect the ""users and node runners"".

I have seen many projects with good ideas fail for the above reasons, and unfortunately, Mysterium seems to be going down the same path.

In any case, I emphasize that the software works well from a user perspective (though we do need an auto-reconnect feature, a better way to sort nodes by quality, and some kind of proxy service before I cancel my commercial subscription). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ts51dt/are_node_runnersusers_happy_with_the_recent_major/i2u43b4/ | There is definitely a lack of transparency with this project. The good thing is that the software mostly works, the bad think is that no one is using it. I think that the community would be ok with this if they felt like they were part of team.  I would simply ask that the developers write a blog post that describes the development roadmap, along with key steps that need to be achieved. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1g8kmp/ | The FAQ hasn't been updated. It notes that ""Mysterium"" takes a 20% cut, but it doesn't explain why and who this goes to. 

In all likelihood, I am probably ok with them doing this, it is just that there is ZERO information about the ""settlement fee"" and how operations and salary are being funded.

I would like to emphasize that it is NOT HARD to fix this problem:

1. Write a blog post describing the structure of the Mysterium team, how the developers are paid, what sources of funding the team has, and what the 20% cut is used for. Is the 20% cut the sole source of funding salaries?
2. Write a second blog post that outlines the development roadmap. Key goals should be provided, along with rough-order-of-magnitude estimates for when they will be completed (i.e., Q1, Q2, etc....).
3. Write a third blog post describing the origin of the traffic that is coming out of the Netherlands. This is probably all test traffic, but WHAT IS BEING TESTED? If you are computing up-time and bandwidth statistics, node runners would like to know!
4. Write a fourth blog post describing what ""whitelisted"" traffic corresponds to. Residential nodes have a lot of risk, and it is quite possible that ""benign"" whitelisted traffic could have unintended consequences (for example, if 100 people log into an the same website from the same IP, the IP could get banned). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1im6uy/ | The NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed. It just shows you who is connected, and for how long. The issue is: Can I prove that it was a Mysterium user who visited a specific site at a specific time? For this, you would need to log each ip that the user visited.

Living in France, I am unwilling to run a non-whitelisted node because the government is pretty strict about these things, and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions. Having the option to generate detailed logs would be very useful.

I also can not assume that the Mysterium whitelisted traffic is benign. There has been no transparency about what this traffic is (or will be, I am assuming all whitelisted traffic is test data now). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hy3q6ji/ | I'm not sure where you got the 1000 MYST number from, but here is what is written on their [blog post](https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol) about the use cases of MYST:

>All node runners will need to stake MYST in the network in order to provide dVPN services. The amount of DAI that can be earned depends on the amount of MYST at stake, which is proportional to the desired value of their daily rewards. The formula for this is 1 MYST = 0.01 DAI.

If you don't want to buy your own MYST to stake, you can also borrow it from the delegation pool

>To support token holders, there will be an opportunity to earn rewards by having a stake in the network. These MYST tokens will be taken out of the market and “frozen” in the Mysterium Delegation Pool. The Delegation Pool is particularly useful for node runners who can’t buy and stake MYST in the network, as they will be able to “rent” tokens from the Pool. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qmowdk/mainnet_launch/hje3frz/ | For comparison: I am in france with a fiber line and 100% uptime. I am running in whitelisted mode so that I only get test traffic (about 1.1 GB per day). After one month, I'll have made about 5 Myst. 

If you want more traffic, you probably want to turn off whitelisting. This means that your node will be visible to the public and that they will be able to download whatever they want.  My understanding is that whitelisting will be for streaming traffic only once they enter mainnet, and that now it is 100% test traffic. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/pwuvky/whats_the_point_in_running_a_node_when_the/hekxh43/ | You are in essence running a Tor exit node. Just do a search on that to see if you are ok with the risk.

Mysterium does have the option of only allowing whitelisted partners to use your node, but as far as I can tell, this whitelisted traffic only exists in a few insignificant countries (I don't think there is any traffic at all in Europe). Perhaps this will be expanded to more countries in the future. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rrauim/what_if_someone_uses_your_node_ip_for_illegal/hqjz2dc/ | It is logical that this would happen, so no proof is required. The BBC detected suspicious behavior and hence blocked the IP address. The interesting question is: What suspicious behavior triggered their bot to do this? Perhaps it was anomalous download rates, or several people logged into the BBC with the same IP address. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rnmwx1/running_a_node_for_a_month_caused_my_ip_to_be/hq2odet/ | Awesome. Now we just need some kind of auto-reconnect and this will start to be useful! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/s8xkvh/mysterium_vpn_adds_kill_switch/htkzf7j/"
362,NeneaPetrica,2,"Hi, I have asked about the same issue. I think there is a general issue with the payment system as I have tried to register a new node today myself and for all 3 transactions, the banks authorized them and they sent the money but the platform gave me the ""payment error"" message.

367,EmoStomper,2,"I get that. But I am surprised it's this low. 

What I'm wondering is if it's limitations of my Pi or only a result of whitelisting. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/syrw0m/node_sessions_seem_low_after_a_month/hxznp8h/ | Which Pi model are you using? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/syrw0m/node_sessions_seem_low_after_a_month/hy2gvlt/ | Keep it up, give it another month (after all these things don't use much power).    


Currently my total earnings are < 0.01 MYST which is around 0.00336122 USD right now.  This is after 114 sessions.   


I figured the following issues might be to blame:  
1. Raspberry PI 3 B+ doesn't have enough resources to be a solid node.  
2. There are too many nodes in my area.  
3.  Whitelisting just doesn't give you that much traffic.

It’s high paying—though you have to be okay with tiered elevation (meaning usually you are hired as a clinical vet and promoted up), there is technically an experience route without residency (note: boards are tough without but not impossible), you can get grants and run your own studies if that suites you, there is a lot of pathology involved if you are interested, work-life balance is phenomenal, university or pharma company benefits, and a lot of residencies set you up with an MPH anyway.|It’s totally fair and not for everyone—but I can confidently say that I euthanize less animals in lab animal than in practice and also, they need healthcare too!

I hope things work out for you!|You’re definitely a real vet! I’m a lab animal vet, and sadly sometimes you hear these things being said. But the truth is that just comes from unhappy, insecure people. What are you getting a PhD in? 

Also, if you are itching for clinical practice, try working some vaccine clinics when you can or try out relief. On top of some clinical work, you will be able to supplement your PhD “wages.”|I totally hear you. But you are also a newer grad, I assume — and honestly just being in the field for more years, you will soak up knowledge and skills if you drive yourself to learn and put yourself in positions for hands on experience! You will also have a new skill of running a clinical trial which is well sought after and sometime lucrative! You’re just carving out your niche— it will be great, you will see!|Reach out to the MBL in woods hole — the AV there is amazing. She may have some ideas!|I think it is important to remember that grades are not everything. Do well yes — but there were so many people in my class that would FIGHT to get for example a 96/100 instead of their 93/100 etc. And they would be so stressed out. 

Literally at the end of the first year of vet school, my roommate and I were kicked out of the condo we were sharing with another classmate. Her reasoning was that she was a straight A student and my roommate and had gotten a few Bs. She went on to be completely miserable the rest of the 3 year and my roommate and I really enjoyed vet school. My roommate and I went on to be specialists of different kinds and she went into GP. GP is great, don’t get me wrong— but there is no reason to be so fixated on grades if you are not trying to specialize. And even if you do specialize, a few Bs won’t ruin your career!"

I've been using Kryptex for a while now, and I've got a good grasp of mining.   
However, I have some questions about Mysterium.
  

  
How can I assess or calculate my monthly profit with Mysterium?   
I've gone through the articles provided by Kryptex, but the profitability of Mysterium remains unclear to me. How is profitability calculated? And how can I boost my earnings without switching to Mysterium Dark?
  

  
It appears that Mysterium Dark (Public) is not recommended, as it might not be safe for me as a Node keeper. I've gone through the terms, but they are not entirely clear. Perhaps, this is a question for the Mysterium Team.
  

  
Looking forward to your insights!|From my understanding, Mysterium VPN users depends on the VPN services and public data from Node Keepers. If the Mysterium Team could shed light on the safety of these options for us—Node Keepers—we could mutually benefit and alleviate any concerns about the ""Dark Side,"" ha-ha :)|Yes, same here. I was asking about Public data, but there was no clear answer.  
It seems Mysterium is pretty safe if using first two B2B switches.|Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I've gone through the articles, and I truly appreciate Kryptex's instructions—they're quite straightforward. However, my inquiry primarily revolves around Mysterium. It would be great to have some approximate data in my WebUI.

Alternatively, maybe there could be a public API so that Kryptex can utilize that information to predict profitability based on LAST\_MONTH\_EARNINGS. Mining profitability fluctuates, and it's acceptable to witness $100 today and $80 tomorrow. The same approach could be implemented for Mysterium.|Hello everyone!

I've been using Kryptex for a while now, and I've got a good grasp of mining.   
However, I have some questions about Mysterium.
  

  
How can I assess or calculate my monthly profit with Mysterium?   
I've gone through the articles provided by Kryptex, but the profitability of Mysterium remains unclear to me. How is profitability calculated? And how can I boost my earnings without switching to Mysterium Dark?
  

  
It appears that Mysterium Dark (Public) is not recommended, as it might not be safe for me as a Node keeper. I've gone through the terms, but they are not entirely clear. Perhaps, this is a question for the Mysterium Team.
  

  
Looking forward to your insights!|From my understanding, Mysterium VPN users depends on the VPN services and public data from Node Keepers. If the Mysterium Team could shed light on the safety of these options for us—Node Keepers—we could mutually benefit and alleviate any concerns about the ""Dark Side,"" ha-ha :)|Yes, same here. I was asking about Public data, but there was no clear answer.

383,Dramatic_Sun_4562,1,"Probably true. Maybe not official offers, with contract to sign and every laid out. But honestly, it’s not that hard to get an offer. Especially from a corporation. Clinics are desperate. The externships I did always told me “let us know if you’re interested and we’ll send you an offer”

But why does it matter how many offers you’re getting anyway? I decided on my top 2 clinics after externships, both gave me offers upon request, no interview required unless I had questions for them. I chose one of the two. Done and done.|I’m a new vet, and I definitely could have been happier in a different career. I was the same way before. I had always loved animals, decided I was going to be a vet at a young age and never really opened my mind to many other ideas. Get a job a vet office and see what it’s like. Obviously you can specialize and things would look different, but most of us end up in small animal GP to start.

Vet school. The hardest part is NOT getting in as much as people want to make that joke. It’s hard to get in. It’s harder to stay motivated to finish. It’s crappy. There’s too much knowledge to retain, more than half of it won’t ever apply (but you need to know it to pass boards), and yet you’re still never really prepared for the real world. It’s so costly (I had really good undergrad scholarships, commuted, and only paid about $10k total, but vet school… $$$$$$).

Being a vet. The hardest part is not putting down animals. That’s what naive people think. That decision is hard for the pet owner. The vet is just there to provide the service. It’s actually sometimes one of the better parts. The hard parts are being over worked, not having enough trained support staff, dealing with difficult or uneducated owners, and not having work life balance. You can get great pay as a vet. But is it worth it to not have a life outside of work? No. Some days I don’t see my toddler because I don’t get home until she’s asleep. Sometimes you don’t get a lunch break. Sick days? Better figure something out because you have patients that need to be seen. Long vacations? If you even get enough time off, you better plan those way in advance. The good parts of the job— leaving on time (rare), seeing the human-animal bond, figuring out a challenging case, CE conventions and being with people who understand the high level stress job.

My advice? Work a a clinic, see the stress firsthand. That’s your future. Go to college, take random classes that peak your interest- photography? History? Earth science? A new language? Art? Open your mind and you will find other opportunities that will bring you joy. You don’t have to decide something this big right now.

The test is honestly set up for people to fail. By the second half of the test, your brain is numb and you can’t think straight. Taking it over 2 days if absolutely the way to go.

The debt is a very understandable concern but if you’re disciplined and don’t have other outrageous debt it is very manageable|I’m a current 4th year and I will be going into ER straight out of school.  I’m doing VEG’s ER training program.  Feel free to message me with questions about it|So in my opinion, most criticism from people who don’t like VEG can’t stand the open concept idea or think VEG people act weird on tiktok (which is honestly true.  I personally hate social media).  As far as their medicine I’m a firm believer in the quality of your medicine being as good as YOU want it to be.  Quality of medicine is much more heavily influenced by a doctors desire to constantly learn and grow rather than lean into complacency.  As far as training to be an ER doctor I don’t think the gap between the VEG training and a traditional internship is much different.  I say that coming from spending about 10 total weeks at a few different well known internship locations paired with 6 weeks at two separate VEG locations.  I’ve seen interns mess up many cases in my vet school and its part of growing.  That’s going to be EVERY training program you see and you will not be perfect no matter what route you choose.  But I liked that VEG’s training program has dedicated journal rounds every week with specialists during your training, CE for ultrasound so you can gain confidence on your FAST scans, and surgical training and anatomy refreshers during your training in the VEG program.  In my opinion many of the complainers with VEG have valid complaints when it comes to VEG draining the owners of money before referrel or reaching an incorrect diagnosis.  I say this to say I would love for any ER doctor to be perfect with their diagnosis and plan.  Then specialty wouldn’t exist….  I do think VEG’s policy on “we find a way to say yes” can be twisted into them not referring until too late.  In my opinion, as an ER doctor, knowing when to refer is a skill in itself.  I think so much gets forgotten on what the purpose of an ER doctor is and VEG is just so in your face that they get a lot of the criticism for problems that are common in many ERs.  Just my opinion.

That said I understand the social media craze and cult like culture with them.  That can definitely be overwhelming if its not your vibe but overall I think their medicine and training is good quality which is why I decided to do their training over a traditional internship or any of the other fast track ER programs.|Regardless of the path you choose, if you are unhappy with where you end up you can always pivot another direction/place.  Your head is in the right place and you’re gonna be a great doctor!|I would spend a few weeks shadowing your vet before making any commitments to the profession.  There are many ways to help animals outside of being a veterinarian|Exactly this.  I didn’t even have a SINGLE radiograph on my exam.  What the fuck.  I didn’t have a question on cushings or diabetes either.  But of course I had a question asking what the most appropriate way to dispose of a syringe was after giving a DHPP vaccine was……|This is what’s giving me major anxiety right now|I passed!  Much higher than my IVCA practice exam scores|Following this as well|Yup that’s me, I’m getting shitfaced and crying regardless of the outcome|Congratulations Dr!!!|I’m sure you killed it!|My practice exams had me on the high range of 420.  I scored 472 on the actual exam|I have accepted my spot in the NERD program with VEG but I feel like I did extensive research about all my options.  I’m not going to lie, I eliminated the BluePearl emERge program pretty quickly due to their manipulative and vague contracts.  Speaking with a representative of the company and talking about the program there is a 2 year commitment to BluePearl after the training year (so 3 years total).  There is also no room for negotiation with your salary during that time and the salary is “a competitive ER doctor salary”.  So no guarantees on your financial numbers, no guarantees on your training, no guarantees on whether or not the hospital you get placed at has willing mentors.  I personally think BluePearl is a mess.  Now this was during my 2nd year so the program may be slightly different now, but I was so turned off after speaking with the rep and seeing the structure of the program that I just eliminated for myself at that point. The huge added benefit of course is having specialty available for you to lean on which is gonna be huge when you are getting started and when you have more complex cases.  Of course people are also recommending the internship route but if you don’t have plans of specializing then imo its not financially wise when the opportunities out there are just so much better.  Also if you want surgical experience, it is basically non existent as a rotating intern.

I chose the NERD program because the 6 month program is similar to an internship in regards to the workload.  You will definitely be working like an intern those first 6 months.  You have 3-4 12 hour shifts each week + 1 didactic day a week + journal clubs.  All that and the pay is 40k for that 6 month period.  In my opinion, the VEG NERD program is like an internship where you don’t rotate through specialty.  Most internships are 1 year long with roughly 50% ER and 50% rotations through the different services in the hospital.  I liked that the VEG Program sends you to a specific ultrasound training course, anatomy and surgery CE, and didactic rounds are taught by boarded specialists.  You’ll see a lot of comments about how VEG botches so many cases and sends everything to referral anyway.  I do think VEG is incredibly expensive and it is sad when docs at VEG use all the clients funding trying to figure something out before going to specialty.  That’s not the doctor I want to be and I think working ER and learning when to refer is a genuine skill learned over time.  There is also NVA mentorship programs that are more hospital specific and require more leg work to find if they are the right fit for you.  Honestly that leg work is worth it when finding your fit because that first year out of school is so important.

This is my experience and I’m happy to chat with anyone more extensively if they would like.  It was a daunting task trying to decide my path and I was very close to accepting an internship outside the match vs the VEG NERD program.|So after the 6 month program you are looking at signing a completely different contract since the NERD program and actually working at VEG after training are separate things.  I get a $2000 bonus for accepting the NERD position and $4000 to relocate.  After that the anticipated salary after completion of training if I decide to stay on is 140,000 or 22% production (whichever is higher)|A bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush.  If you weren’t going to accept a seat at that school then why apply in the first place?

The debt is a very understandable concern but if you’re disciplined and don’t have other outrageous debt it is very manageable|I’m a current 4th year and I will be going into ER straight out of school.  I’m doing VEG’s ER training program.  Feel free to message me with questions about it|So in my opinion, most criticism from people who don’t like VEG can’t stand the open concept idea or think VEG people act weird on tiktok (which is honestly true.  I personally hate social media).  As far as their medicine I’m a firm believer in the quality of your medicine being as good as YOU want it to be.  Quality of medicine is much more heavily influenced by a doctors desire to constantly learn and grow rather than lean into complacency.  As far as training to be an ER doctor I don’t think the gap between the VEG training and a traditional internship is much different.  I say that coming from spending about 10 total weeks at a few different well known internship locations paired with 6 weeks at two separate VEG locations.  I’ve seen interns mess up many cases in my vet school and its part of growing.  That’s going to be EVERY training program you see and you will not be perfect no matter what route you choose.  But I liked that VEG’s training program has dedicated journal rounds every week with specialists during your training, CE for ultrasound so you can gain confidence on your FAST scans, and surgical training and anatomy refreshers during your training in the VEG program.  In my opinion many of the complainers with VEG have valid complaints when it comes to VEG draining the owners of money before referrel or reaching an incorrect diagnosis.  I say this to say I would love for any ER doctor to be perfect with their diagnosis and plan.  Then specialty wouldn’t exist….  I do think VEG’s policy on “we find a way to say yes” can be twisted into them not referring until too late.  In my opinion, as an ER doctor, knowing when to refer is a skill in itself.  I think so much gets forgotten on what the purpose of an ER doctor is and VEG is just so in your face that they get a lot of the criticism for problems that are common in many ERs.  Just my opinion.

I say this to say I would love for any ER doctor to be perfect with their diagnosis and plan.  Then specialty wouldn’t exist….  I do think VEG’s policy on “we find a way to say yes” can be twisted into them not referring until too late.  In my opinion, as an ER doctor, knowing when to refer is a skill in itself.  I think so much gets forgotten on what the purpose of an ER doctor is and VEG is just so in your face that they get a lot of the criticism for problems that are common in many ERs.  Just my opinion.

That said I understand the social media craze and cult like culture with them.  That can definitely be overwhelming if its not your vibe but overall I think their medicine and training is good quality which is why I decided to do their training over a traditional internship or any of the other fast track ER programs.|Regardless of the path you choose, if you are unhappy with where you end up you can always pivot another direction/place.  Your head is in the right place and you’re gonna be a great doctor!|I would spend a few weeks shadowing your vet before making any commitments to the profession.  There are many ways to help animals outside of being a veterinarian|Exactly this.  I didn’t even have a SINGLE radiograph on my exam.  What the fuck.  I didn’t have a question on cushings or diabetes either.  But of course I had a question asking what the most appropriate way to dispose of a syringe was after giving a DHPP vaccine was……|This is what’s giving me major anxiety right now|I passed!  Much higher than my IVCA practice exam scores|Following this as well|Yup that’s me, I’m getting shitfaced and crying regardless of the outcome|Congratulations Dr!!!|I’m sure you killed it!|My practice exams had me on the high range of 420.  I scored 472 on the actual exam|I have accepted my spot in the NERD program with VEG but I feel like I did extensive research about all my options.  I’m not going to lie, I eliminated the BluePearl emERge program pretty quickly due to their manipulative and vague contracts.  Speaking with a representative of the company and talking about the program there is a 2 year commitment to BluePearl after the training year (so 3 years total).  There is also no room for negotiation with your salary during that time and the salary is “a competitive ER doctor salary”.  So no guarantees on your financial numbers, no guarantees on your training, no guarantees on whether or not the hospital you get placed at has willing mentors.  I personally think BluePearl is a mess.  Now this was during my 2nd year so the program may be slightly different now, but I was so turned off after speaking with the rep and seeing the structure of the program that I just eliminated for myself at that point. The huge added benefit of course is having specialty available for you to lean on which is gonna be huge when you are getting started and when you have more complex cases.  Of course people are also recommending the internship route but if you don’t have plans of specializing then imo its not financially wise when the opportunities out there are just so much better.  Also if you want surgical experience, it is basically non existent as a rotating intern.

I chose the NERD program because the 6 month program is similar to an internship in regards to the workload.  You will definitely be working like an intern those first 6 months.  You have 3-4 12 hour shifts each week + 1 didactic day a week + journal clubs.  All that and the pay is 40k for that 6 month period.  In my opinion, the VEG NERD program is like an internship where you don’t rotate through specialty.  Most internships are 1 year long with roughly 50% ER and 50% rotations through the different services in the hospital.  I liked that the VEG Program sends you to a specific ultrasound training course, anatomy and surgery CE, and didactic rounds are taught by boarded specialists.  You’ll see a lot of comments about how VEG botches so many cases and sends everything to referral anyway.  I do think VEG is incredibly expensive and it is sad when docs at VEG use all the clients funding trying to figure something out before going to specialty.  That’s not the doctor I want to be and I think working ER and learning when to refer is a genuine skill learned over time.  There is also NVA mentorship programs that are more hospital specific and require more leg work to find if they are the right fit for you.  Honestly that leg work is worth it when finding your fit because that first year out of school is so important.

This is my experience and I’m happy to chat with anyone more extensively if they would like.  It was a daunting task trying to decide my path and I was very close to accepting an internship outside the match vs the VEG NERD program.|So after the 6 month program you are looking at signing a completely different contract since the NERD program and actually working at VEG after training are separate things.  I get a $2000 bonus for accepting the NERD position and $4000 to relocate.  After that the anticipated salary after completion of training if I decide to stay on is 140,000 or 22% production (whichever is higher)|A bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush.  If you weren’t going to accept a seat at that school then why apply in the first place?

The debt is a very understandable concern but if you’re disciplined and don’t have other outrageous debt it is very manageable|I’m a current 4th year and I will be going into ER straight out of school.  I’m doing VEG’s ER training program.  Feel free to message me with questions about it|So in my opinion, most criticism from people who don’t like VEG can’t stand the open concept idea or think VEG people act weird on tiktok (which is honestly true.  I personally hate social media).  As far as their medicine I’m a firm believer in the quality of your medicine being as good as YOU want it to be.  Quality of medicine is much more heavily influenced by a doctors desire to constantly learn and grow rather than lean into complacency.  As far as training to be an ER doctor I don’t think the gap between the VEG training and a traditional internship is much different.  I say that coming from spending about 10 total weeks at a few different well known internship locations paired with 6 weeks at two separate VEG locations.  I’ve seen interns mess up many cases in my vet school and its part of growing.  That’s going to be EVERY training program you see and you will not be perfect no matter what route you choose.  But I liked that VEG’s training program has dedicated journal rounds every week with specialists during your training, CE for ultrasound so you can gain confidence on your FAST scans, and surgical training and anatomy refreshers during your training in the VEG program.

904,allthejellyfish,2,Basically you don't. I've been in the field for 10+ years and was almost done with my technology degree when it donned on me that I'd literally be making the same amount I was already making as an assistant. So I said screw it and got my bachelor's in wildlife biology. But I will say one thing you can do with a vet tech degree that will make decent money is working at a veterinary lab like idexx or zoetis. You typically make around 20-25 dollars depending on where you go. You aren't working directly with animals anymore but it's a good alternative to working in a clinic setting for pennies.

908,Varishta,1,"I would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic. You may fall in love and discover your passion, or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job. Working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect, so I would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place. Loving cats is a great start, but that alone isn’t a good reason to work for a vet. Make sure you’re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are. 

If you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it, there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. They are similar but different positions, especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed. Vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more, but also means more schooling and more responsibility/stress. There are legitimate, respected vet tech schools online, but you’ll still need to find a physical clinic to work with and let you learn the physical skills involved in order to complete the program. In general, vet med is a heavily education and science based field, so more education is generally looked upon favorably, so long as it is from reputable sources.

Vet assistant doesn’t require any courses, though online courses exist and may or may not give you a boost at getting a job as an assistant. Many of them are on the job trained, but that’s easier to do if they at least have some background in working with animals. Kennel assistant is similar and also typically on the job trained, however the pay for both of these positions is usually quite low. I would check job listings in your area to see if it’s even financially feasible for you. 

The last bit of advice I have is to also consider finding a non-animal job with a better work-life balance and make volunteering with cats at the humane society or a rescue more of a hobby. Some people make a career out of something they love, and find that it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it versus when it was a hobby or something they did in their free time. Veterinary professionals have a significantly higher rate of suicide than the general public, one of the highest suicide rates of any profession, because we are all very passionate about animals, but the nature of the job is very physically and emotionally draining. Consider if your mental and emotional health can cope with clients screaming at you and accusing you of personally murdering their dog because they didn’t bring it in soon enough or because the client can’t pay for care, cope with neglectful owners, cope with euthanizing animals that could otherwise be saved, cope with making a mistake that may cost an animal their life, and overall cope with seeing animals suffer on a daily basis. It can be a very rewarding job, but there are days where it will absolutely beat you to the ground and keep kicking while you’re there. This is why I would strongly advise shadowing before deciding if it’s for you or not. There’s nothing wrong with taking a non-animal job and making animals how you decompress in your free time instead.|I wouldn’t get as hung up on taking notes about what you learn. It will likely be pretty overwhelming in the beginning, and as others have said, you’ll have years to learn that stuff in depth. Simple repeated exposure to terminology and concepts will help them stick better down the road. Have a notebook handy for sure, but don’t try to record every single thing you learn. 

If you’re in the US or would be applying to US vet schools, what I would recommend doing is taking basic notes about when you started and finished shadowing there, a record of how many hours you’ve spent there, and general notes on what you were able to do/see. Such as helping restrain patients, observing dentals and surgeries, staining slides, cleaning kennels, etc. If/when you apply to vet school, the application wants all of these details. I had a heck of a time trying to come up with start/end dates and hours of experiences I had many years prior. Keeping track of your experiences now will make that easier down the line.|I didn’t find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I’m glad I didn’t waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn’t study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they’re used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments. Be aware of which ones are zoonotic or ones important to public health and why. That covers the large bulk of the questions. Then brush up on your antibiotic and common parasite knowledge, a bit of epidemiology concepts/equations, and some basic business concepts, and you’ll be pretty well rounded on the necessary knowledge. I don’t understand why spending a couple hundred hours answering questions has become so many people’s main study method. If it works for you, great. But I found directly studying the diseases to be a much better use of my time.|Apparently some people were getting scores with other people’s names on them.

I don’t understand why spending a couple hundred hours answering questions has become so many people’s main study method. If it works for you, great. But I found directly studying the diseases to be a much better use of my time.|Apparently some people were getting scores with other people’s names on them. Whether it was actually their report or not I don’t know, but they tried to release them and had to retract it. Hopefully they get it sorted quick and still release them today.|As someone currently in their small animal internal medicine rotation with just 2 other students, trying to keep up with multiple in-depth work ups each day plus rechecks, I’m both appalled and a little jealous that some schools have students sharing cases.|I would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic. You may fall in love and discover your passion, or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job. Working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect, so I would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place. Loving cats is a great start, but that alone isn’t a good reason to work for a vet. Make sure you’re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are. 

If you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it, there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. They are similar but different positions, especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed. Vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more, but also means more schooling and more responsibility/stress. There are legitimate, respected vet tech schools online, but you’ll still need to find a physical clinic to work with and let you learn the physical skills involved in order to complete the program. In general, vet med is a heavily education and science based field, so more education is generally looked upon favorably, so long as it is from reputable sources.

Vet assistant doesn’t require any courses, though online courses exist and may or may not give you a boost at getting a job as an assistant. Many of them are on the job trained, but that’s easier to do if they at least have some background in working with animals. Kennel assistant is similar and also typically on the job trained, however the pay for both of these positions is usually quite low. I would check job listings in your area to see if it’s even financially feasible for you. 

The last bit of advice I have is to also consider finding a non-animal job with a better work-life balance and make volunteering with cats at the humane society or a rescue more of a hobby. Some people make a career out of something they love, and find that it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it versus when it was a hobby or something they did in their free time. Veterinary professionals have a significantly higher rate of suicide than the general public, one of the highest suicide rates of any profession, because we are all very passionate about animals, but the nature of the job is very physically and emotionally draining. Consider if your mental and emotional health can cope with clients screaming at you and accusing you of personally murdering their dog because they didn’t bring it in soon enough or because the client can’t pay for care, cope with neglectful owners, cope with euthanizing animals that could otherwise be saved, cope with making a mistake that may cost an animal their life, and overall cope with seeing animals suffer on a daily basis. It can be a very rewarding job, but there are days where it will absolutely beat you to the ground and keep kicking while you’re there. This is why I would strongly advise shadowing before deciding if it’s for you or not. There’s nothing wrong with taking a non-animal job and making animals how you decompress in your free time instead.|I wouldn’t get as hung up on taking notes about what you learn. It will likely be pretty overwhelming in the beginning, and as others have said, you’ll have years to learn that stuff in depth. Simple repeated exposure to terminology and concepts will help them stick better down the road. Have a notebook handy for sure, but don’t try to record every single thing you learn. 

If you’re in the US or would be applying to US vet schools, what I would recommend doing is taking basic notes about when you started and finished shadowing there, a record of how many hours you’ve spent there, and general notes on what you were able to do/see. Such as helping restrain patients, observing dentals and surgeries, staining slides, cleaning kennels, etc. If/when you apply to vet school, the application wants all of these details. I had a heck of a time trying to come up with start/end dates and hours of experiences I had many years prior. Keeping track of your experiences now will make that easier down the line.|I didn’t find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I’m glad I didn’t waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn’t study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they’re used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments.

Very true points, but if a doctor asks to be referred to as ""Dr. So-and-so"", part of that respect being a two way street is that it needs to happen. Not ignored and refused. That's disrespectful, and whether you respect the person or not, all involved should be respecting the title.

Very true points, but if a doctor asks to be referred to as ""Dr. So-and-so"", part of that respect being a two way street is that it needs to happen. Not ignored and refused. That's disrespectful, and whether you respect the person or not, all involved should be respecting the title.

If a Doctor wants to be referred to that way (as long as it doesn't go against the clinic/standard) then that's what you do. It's not up to a tech in how to refer to a doctor. 

And if you techs reading this don't like that?? Damn, keep it to yourself.|As a former tech here, get over yourself? 

A doctor has earned the right to be called that if they wish. If they ask, and you refuse, that's you being disrespectful. You respect the title at least, regardless of how you feel about the person. 

It has NOTHING to do with being of equal importance. It has NOTHING to do with being a slap in the face.
It has NOTHING to do with speaking negative volumes.

You're a tech, extremely important and vital, yes. But, they are doctors, and it well within their right to be referred to as such. I've worked with arrogant ones, and with humble ones. They all earned the title, and have the right to be referred to as Doctor. 

If you don't like that, don't work with doctors.|The whole fking industry is toxic. Most clinics, most teams...it's a shitshow|Age has no merit to this conversation. 

You went to school, YOU got the degree, they adhere to your title if that's what you want. End of story. Any tech that disagrees is a jealous tech and needs to stfu

Because every seizure case needs to be carefully personalized to each patient, I recommend just pawning off the client to the doc. There are lots of subtleties, what ifs, and what to expect with seizures. I send them home with lots of handouts. Sometimes they need to be referred to a neuro specialist.

SWO @ 555-12-1234 P seems itchy like she was last year. O asks if P can refill last med instead of coming in. Informed O that DVM recs exam +/- SS, cytology, or other lab work depending on PE findings. May also consider b/w as P is due for dental soon. O will consider and cb.  Detailed estimate emailed to owner@email.com|I hear you with the “tech spoke for 20 mins re seizures and documented almost none of it so who knows what the O expects or not, or what the tech rec’d.” 

It’s not ideal but jeez does it seem to be the norm. 

I’d say skip trying to understand the picture - taking an accurate, non-convoluted, and *actually useful* patient history is a skilled art form that I am still(!) practicing even 12 years out of vet school. The sicker they are, the harder to understand “what is going on & what recent changes occurred” and would say extracting that is a skill just as refined as any surgical procedure I perform. When they are scared, they ramble word salad. They pick up on any cues you give them and run with it. They confuse who said what and when. 

Which answers most of why techs don’t document much: they are burned out by experience. Clients will keep you on the phone way longer than needed, and the difference between what you tell them and what they hear can be an ever widening gulf. Punt it to us DVMs, it’s our gig to try to make the most sense of these cases. 

There’s 100 memories of me having a 45 min conversation with a client nodding along, only to find out at the next recheck that I failed to communicate the importance of something important to the patient healing properly. Another 100 memories of listening to a client talk for 10 minutes, me scribbling down notes, then looking up and realizing I am still not any deeper into understanding the clinical picture. Another 100 for when O tells the technician “I’ve never seen P do XYZ,” then me walk in the room and state “P has been constantly doing XYZ.” It’s frustrating, but we are all imperfect. 

Going back to seizures specifically for a moment. Moving forward it may be best not to assure them that a cause will be found. The most common cause of seizures is called “Idiopathic Epilepsy,” idiopathic being the medical term for “We don’t know what the cause is.” Most seizure patients (except in specific instances) never receive a specific diagnosis. We mostly just spend our time trying to minimize the frequency and severity of the seizures, check for medication adjustments, and monitor how the body is handling being on an anti-seizure medication. 

My major point is : No one without a medical degree is expected to have that knowledge off the tip of their tongue. It’s unfair of the clients to try to get you in that position, to calm them, assuage their fears, promise everything is going to be okay. You are doing a fantastic job, and I’ll agree that I prefer overly detailed notes rather than none. Don’t let clients push you around and try to pin you down for medical information. Let them know you are here to get their pet’s issue(s) addressed, and the medical team will be ready to answer all their concerns.

Best of luck!! Hopefully you find this note reassuring and supportive rather than condescending and preachy.|Hi, I’m not sure if you’re interested in large/small animals but any experience with any of them will help:

- Shelter worker. 
- Rescue volunteer (there are a billion)
- Working cattle
- Horse riding 
- 4H anything
- Slaughterhouse/butchers (yeah, even that).

Unless you have a personal, familial relationship with a specific veterinarian, shadowing is not typical. They do not have the liability coverage for you unfortunately.

Try to get hired! Memorize normal species temperature, learn how to take a heart rate, and apply to be a veterinary technician or kennel technician. Convince them you know how to operate a washer/dryer, don’t have to be taught how to sweep & mop, you’re not scared to get dirty, and you stay cheerful with a good attitude when faced with being told to do disgusting chores.

Another 100 memories of listening to a client talk for 10 minutes, me scribbling down notes, then looking up and realizing I am still not any deeper into understanding the clinical picture. Another 100 for when O tells the technician “I’ve never seen P do XYZ,” then me walk in the room and state “P has been constantly doing XYZ.” It’s frustrating, but we are all imperfect. 

Going back to seizures specifically for a moment. Moving forward it may be best not to assure them that a cause will be found. The most common cause of seizures is called “Idiopathic Epilepsy,” idiopathic being the medical term for “We don’t know what the cause is.” Most seizure patients (except in specific instances) never receive a specific diagnosis. We mostly just spend our time trying to minimize the frequency and severity of the seizures, check for medication adjustments, and monitor how the body is handling being on an anti-seizure medication. 

My major point is : No one without a medical degree is expected to have that knowledge off the tip of their tongue. It’s unfair of the clients to try to get you in that position, to calm them, assuage their fears, promise everything is going to be okay. You are doing a fantastic job, and I’ll agree that I prefer overly detailed notes rather than none. Don’t let clients push you around and try to pin you down for medical information. Let them know you are here to get their pet’s issue(s) addressed, and the medical team will be ready to answer all their concerns.

Best of luck!! Hopefully you find this note reassuring and supportive rather than condescending and preachy.|Hi, I’m not sure if you’re interested in large/small animals but any experience with any of them will help:

- Shelter worker. 
- Rescue volunteer (there are a billion)
- Working cattle
- Horse riding 
- 4H anything
- Slaughterhouse/butchers (yeah, even that).

Unless you have a personal, familial relationship with a specific veterinarian, shadowing is not typical. They do not have the liability coverage for you unfortunately.

Try to get hired! Memorize normal species temperature, learn how to take a heart rate, and apply to be a veterinary technician or kennel technician. Convince them you know how to operate a washer/dryer, don’t have to be taught how to sweep & mop, you’re not scared to get dirty, and you stay cheerful with a good attitude when faced with being told to do disgusting chores. 

Good luck!

Also search for veterinary groups of Facebook and join those, they may add CE you didn’t realize you needed, or just levity :)|Mine have First Name Last Name DVM.

I always introduce myself to clients with a handshake & “Hi, I’m First Name Last Name, good to meet you,” never Dr. Last Name

I want to avoid pretentiousness as much as possible though because I’m in the American South and suspicion/resentment of “doctors/educated type” is at an all time high, and I need maximum buy in from the client to establish a baseline of trust.|All the clinic practices I’ve worked at have strongly encouraged me to go by Dr. First Name to avoid pretense, but I feel like an early childhood educator by that method. I abhor it.|Regarding seizures specifically, you were in a tough spot here. They are very scary to O’s and they have a lot of (very good) questions. Im of the opinion that none of these ought to be addressed by reception or even a technician - because each answer is likely to trigger a new waterfall of questions, going deeper and deeper into the weeds. 

Because every seizure case needs to be carefully personalized to each patient, I recommend just pawning off the client to the doc. There are lots of subtleties, what ifs, and what to expect with seizures. I send them home with lots of handouts. Sometimes they need to be referred to a neuro specialist. 

I know it’s tempting, because they are scared and they are on the other end of the phone, but for your sanity, get them into a room with the DVM, or at least on the phone with one.|Veterinarian here. My Avimark notes are filled with acronyms to keep it short but still convey info. I notice that the tendency of reception is to try to convey tone, but that strategy can get long winded. 

An ex of my notes would look like this:

SWO @ 555-12-1234 P seems itchy like she was last year. O asks if P can refill last med instead of coming in. Informed O that DVM recs exam +/- SS, cytology, or other lab work depending on PE findings. May also consider b/w as P is due for dental soon. O will consider and cb.  Detailed estimate emailed to owner@email.com|I hear you with the “tech spoke for 20 mins re seizures and documented almost none of it so who knows what the O expects or not, or what the tech rec’d.” 

It’s not ideal but jeez does it seem to be the norm. 

I’d say skip trying to understand the picture - taking an accurate, non-convoluted, and *actually useful* patient history is a skilled art form that I am still(!) practicing even 12 years out of vet school. The sicker they are, the harder to understand “what is going on & what recent changes occurred” and would say extracting that is a skill just as refined as any surgical procedure I perform. When they are scared, they ramble word salad. They pick up on any cues you give them and run with it. They confuse who said what and when. 

Which answers most of why techs don’t document much: they are burned out by experience. Clients will keep you on the phone way longer than needed, and the difference between what you tell them and what they hear can be an ever widening gulf.

One of my clinics ive had pretty good support, but they're informal with everyone, no Dr. gets referred to as Dr by staff except one practice owner.

The other one i've gotten some push back from assistants and techs because I stray from the way the medical director that they'd been used to from the last 2 years does things, she brought it up to me, I just don't care, it's what i'm comfortable with and I have contingency plans and am open to other opinions if my first tries don't take. I get both Dr. first name, and just first name, because its what i'm used to (oldest brother is a pharmacist and my dad was an ER doc, I don't like Dr. Lastname because its what they get too, it's weird to me).

Example, I tend to not immediately push for Tear testing / Fluorescein staining the first time I see an animal (she does) for a conjunctival issue (I offer it, but if i'm not immediately leaning toward using a steroid what would it change knowing that the pet has a tiny corneal ulcer / abrasion or not?)|You have to budget your mental energy

You don’t deserve to be treated like you are.|All I know is that the one radiologist we have at my vet school makes more money than our Dean, so it’s definitely a great paying job once you get board certified|There’s always public service loan forgiveness for loans.

She had a meeting with the area chief vet and came out clearly obvious she had been crying and then I think the next day or so she said she was going to change to one day a week in September. Then not terribly long after I had gone back to school it seemed like she got a new job at the shelter up the street based off facebook. I wonder if she there was something up with her performance metrics. She graduated in Jan 2021|I found “Becoming a Millennial Veterinarian” by Ashley Grey very nice.

If you think they were worth it come April, can you send me a message (if you remember, no worries if not)? I don’t take the NAVLE until Nov/Dec for the first time

Edit: grammar fix|Wooo! Thanks for all of the great info!!! I won’t be taking the NAVLE until the upcoming Nov-Dec window, but I was just curious about the accommodations and how far advance should I be beginning to do the paperwork, forms, documentation or whatever to make sure I get the extra time when I sit for the exam?|Thanks so much! I had briefly looked into it before but it is a lot more than I expected so I’ll definitely begin working on that packet as early as I can|I plan on applying for a shelter medicine internship for right outside of school mostly because I am worried I might not find good mentorship easily right off the bat in a shelter. You can create a VIRMP account and look at the different programs right now since the application window is open for another couple months.|SAVMA symposium was super fun because of the networking and the wetlab I did there was my first exposure to teeth extraction which was fun to learn and gave me an advantage when our class did them next semester.

When it comes to making friends, don’t spread yourself too thin trying to get to know everyone super well, but find a good circle without drama and who you can count on for school and *some* personal stuff.

Try to find ways to get surgical experience early on. I did my first canine neuter with RAVS and it was really cool experience. My first cat neuter experience came from a club. I didn’t get much spay experience beyond a little bit during my RAVS trip but I wished I had sought to work with more vets during breaks who would’ve let me do parts of the surgery instead of watching.

But also definitely just be excited about learning in general, there’s so many cool opportunities to do so during vet school!"

953,LadyKay--,2,"Beautifully written. I agree wholeheartedly with practically everything you’ve written here. I have a strong interest in ECC but have adamantly refused to subject myself to an internship for the very reasons you’ve listed above.

I’ve seen enough from my own institution that I knew the lifestyle wasn’t for me and quite frankly, shouldn’t be for anyone. Additionally, something you said stood out to me - that “some may be bitter that their time, money and respect was stolen from them and would like others to experience how it feels”. I’ve witnessed this myself; veterinarians both boarded and non-boarded have expressed doubt in my decision to not pursue an internship. Almost as if it’s a rite of passage to experience such conditions. And of course, there’s programs out there that may be the exception to these statements but from what I understand, they are few and far between. 

Thank you for posting this OP, hopefully you are able to get this published on a larger platform for a greater discussion.|Beautifully written.

I have a strong interest in ECC but have adamantly refused to subject myself to an internship for the very reasons you’ve listed above.

I’ve seen enough from my own institution that I knew the lifestyle wasn’t for me and quite frankly, shouldn’t be for anyone. Additionally, something you said stood out to me - that “some may be bitter that their time, money and respect was stolen from them and would like others to experience how it feels”. I’ve witnessed this myself; veterinarians both boarded and non-boarded have expressed doubt in my decision to not pursue an internship. Almost as if it’s a rite of passage to experience such conditions. And of course, there’s programs out there that may be the exception to these statements but from what I understand, they are few and far between.

959,pongaway,1,"I once had an oncology MD storm in and make a scene with my staff because her family member had approved a cPL for her acutely vomiting dog. This was someone that she herself had approved to make treatment decisions. I got her in a room and she was ranting at me, condescendingly and loudly, saying pancreatitis HAD TO be chronic and I had no etiology blah, blah, blah. All over a $50, medically appropriate diagnostic. I didn't feel like dealing with that level of crazy that particular day so I comped her test, said that pancreatitis in animals is in fact different compared to humans, and sent her on her way. She said she would ""do her research"" lol. Ok doc. In general though, nurses are the worst clients. By far. They have to let you know they are nurses. Every. Time."

I defiantly would talk with them and also let them know you will be talking to superiors about the issue.|You sound similar to me… since I was 8 years old it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. I HATED HIGH SCHOOL! In a class of 250 students I was ranked 198 with a 2.32 GPA. I graduated in 2006…

4 years later I started at a technical college and graduated with an Associate’s Degree in 2013. I moved on and went for my Bachelor’s in Business Administration, in the meantime I spent time doing various other jobs including insurance for 4 years. Learned alot but still didn’t feel at home with what I was doing. I graduated in 2022 with my Bachelor’s in Business Administration. 

Just over 3/4 the way through the Business Administration degree, I had to enroll in a  freshman Biology course for the distance education degree I was working on. That course led me to take microbiology. I then signed up for Gen Chemistry to prove to myself I could do it. (I basically failed my Chem class in HS) That Gen Chem class ended with an A and I took the 2nd half of the year course that Spring, and then the professor convinced me to take the years worth of Organic Chemistry. You guessed it, I did very well. After I graduated in the Spring of 2022 with my BS in Business Administration, I enrolled in Spring of 2023 at the college I took 3/4 of my science courses with a Biology major with emphasis in Animal Biology & Pre-Veterinary medicine. I had finished all but two classes and applied my first Cycle in 2022 with the VMCAS. I was rejected from every Veterinary school I applied too. 

If any of them offer file reviews DO THE REVIEW! I took the two offers for the file review… did what they told me I should do for the Summer of 2023. I reapplied on the VMCAS cycle for the Fall 2024 Veterinary School admissions. I applied to 7 schools. Waitlisted at 3 - had interviews at 3, outright rejected from two, and was accepted to two schools. I am choosing UW-Madison to go too. On top of that I am graduating this Spring 2024 with another two Bachelor’s Degrees. 

What I am saying is being persistent, resilient and learning through the process is HUGE! Do what your gut is telling you. I wish I did sooner.

I should add that I have major self doubt, self confidence and I have a hard time believing in myself. I’m always asking if I really can do it. Even now with me being accepted I’m worried I won’t make it through Veterinary College. 

I turned 36 this year…

969,Scared_Appearance_91,2,I recommend bringing a notebook but spend more time immersing yourself in the experience versus trying to write everything down. You will have up to 8 years or more to learn all of the finer details. Ask questions and get advice but try to learn more about your passion and why you would enjoy the field versus trying to learn anything medical. My first job shadow sticks out to me not because of the facts I learned but because of the passion the vets had for their jobs.

990,Effective-Clock-7333,1,"San Francisco, CA here! We added another doctor in October (to make 5 FT) and then were horribly slow through the rest of 2023 and into january. We noticed that the beginning and ends of the week would fill so Wednesday when all doctors were working, we were so slow across the board. So we spread doctor schedules out a bit more and trained our front desk to be more intentional about trying to schedule mid week. We are finally picking up. But honestly, i was speaking with the other doctors and despite being so bored some days, i’ve liked the change of pace to allow me more time per appointment and feel more inclined to really work things up. As has been mentioned in other comments, it has helped me slow down, develop my soft skills, spend more time researching weird labwork results, consult with other doctors, etc. 
For the last two months, all of our average invoices have gone up by $100-150. Because we are working things up and taking more time to explain value of diagnostics or do those sedation procedures in real time. 
One of our doctors is leaving at the end of this month, so I think things will spread out more evenly soon. I also think there was a national slowdown that is now improving. 
Hang in there!|scribenote user here! It has been such a great resource for me and made my records so much more consistent. I’m at a four doc practice and two of us vets use it. I love it!

So we spread doctor schedules out a bit more and trained our front desk to be more intentional about trying to schedule mid week. We are finally picking up. But honestly, i was speaking with the other doctors and despite being so bored some days, i’ve liked the change of pace to allow me more time per appointment and feel more inclined to really work things up. As has been mentioned in other comments, it has helped me slow down, develop my soft skills, spend more time researching weird labwork results, consult with other doctors, etc. 
For the last two months, all of our average invoices have gone up by $100-150. Because we are working things up and taking more time to explain value of diagnostics or do those sedation procedures in real time. 
One of our doctors is leaving at the end of this month, so I think things will spread out more evenly soon. I also think there was a national slowdown that is now improving. 
Hang in there!|salary depends a lot on location and specialty. Small animal ER vets generally make the most of everyone. I’m in the bay area, started making 125k as a new grad doing small animal GP. Yes I have loads of student debt but it’s federal, so payback has been delayed with Covid and now payments can’t be more than 10% of the income i take home, so it will never bleed me dry- it’s obviously just very annoying to be giving away over 1k a month in payments. Honestly, i find it all very manageable. I have no family money, i am not independently wealthy, I worked three part time jobs in undergrad and vet school, still graduated with no savings. Two years out, I feel very financially comfortable. I did not join this field for the money, I did it because i love it, but if i sit and think about my debt, it would make me miserable. I pay my loans, I do fun stuff when i’m not working, all is well. But maybe don’t join the field for the money.|people who have a soul?|omg i am so sorry that happened! you should not be feeling that guilt on top of something so stressful! You are not a fuck up!! You are not a fuck up! You absolutely deserve mentorship and a safe place to learn. Literally what it’s all about. If that on site vet is not comfortable providing that and getting you out of a pinch sometimes, that’s on her and not you. 
Practice is obviously the biggest way to get a feel for tension you need, but also take it SLOW and check yourself over and over. it is not a race!!!! We are typically castrating young and healthy dogs so a couple extra minutes under anesthesia is ok in order to make sure your ties are secure. 
I have been in hairy moments and start moving faster because i’m worried, but that’s usually when i make more and other mistakes. Deep breaths, ask for help, keep learning and growing!|I had no financial help from family and basically came from undergrad, so limited savings. I took out max student loans out of necessity and that left me with roughly $900 a month to spend on everything besides rent (not other bills). I worked three jobs in vet school, one was an overnight on-call tech for the radiology department and I was able to keep that all 4 years. It sucked getting up in the middle of the night, sometimes every few hours, but i was able to do it despite my day time schedule. It also was really great experience. In colorado (where I went), students could also apply for food stamps. Which I did by my second year and that also helped me dramatically in my day to day experience. I can’t say how many hours/week I was working because that was hugely based on my school schedule. I liked working for the teaching hospital/vet school because they were extremely understanding about my student responsibilities. Whereas working outside of the college meant less of that.

995,ACatOfTheCanals,1,"I worked a year in GP, feeling the same dread and anxiety you did. It sucked. The anxiety and self-doubt I felt every day was terrible. The only thing that helped me was having a wonderful support system outside of work, AND working at a clinic that had zero tolerance for toxicity. 

But I knew myself. And I knew end of life care was where I wanted to end up. I worked that year in GP so that I would have more context, experience, clinical knowledge, etc. I don’t regret it. But man, it almost broke me.

At the end of that year, I bid GP goodbye forever and am now working as an IHE vet and am more content with my life choices than ever. |I just wanted to chime in with a slightly different experience. While it may be very true that, for you, it’s just this clinic that is the problem—it’s also possible that maybe it is general practice itself that you aren’t comfortable with.

I spent a year, miserable, in GP. I actually had a relatively supportive mentor and pretty friendly staff. I was just terrified, everyday, of making a mistake. It was all-consuming. I was miserable on my days off. I would stress about patients when I was home. I hated that appointment times were so short, and that I had to treat each patient and owner so briefly. I knew two months into GP that it was a bad fit. Family and friends told me to stick it out. They told me it was just this clinic; if I went somewhere else, somewhere with more support, then I’d have an easier time with it and learn to live with it. 

Literally the ONLY times in GP when I wasn’t crippled with self-doubt were when I was performing euthanasias and having end-of-life conversations. I felt confident, self-assured when I was approaching an end-of-life case—the way that my vet friends would talk about their GP jobs. And I realized two months into GP that end-of-life care was my calling.

I stuck it out for the full year though—not because I wasn’t sure about making the switch, but because it took me ten more months to convince my partner, friends, and parents that I wasn’t insane for ditching GP to go into end-of-life care. They told me I was wasting my degree, that I’d lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.

I took a month off between my GP job before I started with my in-home euthanasia job to reset my mental health. I’ve been in end-of-life care now for a year and a half, and I have never been more fulfilled or at peace with my decision. This is where I belong. And if I had listened to everyone else who had told me that I should stay in GP, I would be very, very miserable. 

That’s not me saying GP is a bad fit for you. I just wanted to provide an alternate take to leaving veterinary medicine entirely.|I left small animal general practice after only a year, and even that one year was a struggle for me emotionally.

Add piercings and multicolored hair dye and you'll fit right in.|This is an all too common occurrence: a toxic staff. This is not ok.|that is toxic AF. Do not allow them to make you start to doubt yourself, I know women and especially veterinarians are generally way too good at that on their own. You're a skilled medical doctor with great training and growing experience. 

There are tons of practices dying for someone to join them. I'd GTFO as soon as I could. that is an untenable environment to work in. And when you leave, tell them why.|This is an all too common occurrence: a toxic staff. This is not ok.|I have not met too many veterinarians who don't have a bad case of imposter syndrome, it is such a plague. Especially the women. It will likely dissipate with time, experience, confidence and maybe counseling.

998,BirdLawOnly,2,"Their treatment towards you in uncalled for, but as an LVT of nearly a decade, I understand not wanting a new grad touching my animal. Don't get me wrong, they could be more delicate. Here is my reasoning:

Those who get accepted into vet school have good book smarts, but the applicable veterinary skills are often no more than kennel attendant and grooming. I have done A LOT of work with 4th year residents coming through my HQHVSN clinic, and they have no technical skills. Can't restrain, can't draw blood, can't place a catheter, can't do much of anything. Sure, that's why you have techs, but you should be able to perform these tasks should you be short. 45min for a routine spay is good starting out, but too long overall, granted I work with doctors who do 100lb spays in 15min, and cat spays in 2min. Basically, we see new grad DVMs as babies- sponges of book knowledge but no ability to put it to use. Again, their treatment towards you is messed up, but the reasoning is there."
